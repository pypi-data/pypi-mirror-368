Project Structure
-----------------

- Core Code: `modern_form_utils/`
- Tests: `tests/`
- Templates: `modern_form_utils/templates/`
- JavaScript: `modern_form_utils/media/`

Testing
-------

To run the test suite:

```bash
python tests/runtests.py
```

Or use `tox` to run tests against all supported Python and Django versions:

```bash
pip install tox
tox
```

Supported test environments include:

- Python 3.8 – 3.12
- Django 3.2, 4.2, 5.0+

Tox will automatically detect which Python versions are available on your machine and run only those environments. Full test coverage across all environments is required before merging pull requests.

Continuous Integration
----------------------

If you're contributing frequently, consider setting up pre-commit hooks or using GitHub Actions locally to match our CI testing matrix.

Code Style
----------

Follow these guidelines for code consistency:

- Use `black` or `ruff` (recommended) for formatting
- Keep code backward-compatible with Django 3.2+
- Use modern Python 3.8+ features, but avoid breaking compatibility with lower-supported versions

Releases
--------

Maintainers will handle PyPI publishing and version tagging.  
Please do not manually bump versions in `setup.cfg` or `pyproject.toml`.
