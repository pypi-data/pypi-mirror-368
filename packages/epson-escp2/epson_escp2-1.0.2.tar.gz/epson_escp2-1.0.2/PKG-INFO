# **epson_escp2**

A Python module to generate raw ESC/P2 sequences from structured text or images, including markdown-style formatting, tables, and varying font styles.

The text or the image is converted into the "Transfer Raster image" ESC/P2 command `ESC i r c b nL nH mL mH d1......dk` and printed as monochrome B/W bitmap in draft/economy mode.

Supported modes:

- non compressed or "Run Length Encoding" compression method
- bit length 1, 2, or 3 (small dot: 01, medium dot: 10, large dot 03)

The `epson_escp2` module also provides tools for generating maintenance commands and decoding ESC/P2 command sequences.

The ESC/P2 decoder is comprehensive of all the individual command specifications and all remote mode commands described in the "EPSON Programming Guide For 4 Color EPSON Ink Jet Printer XP-410" and it is also able to print and dump tiled images produced by the "Transfer Raster image" ESC/P2 commands.

Epson’s **ESC/P2** is Epson’s extended page description language that enables advanced font manipulation, raster graphics, and layout control on Inkjet printers.

## Features

- Convert text with markdown-like formatting to ESC/P2 commands
- Convert images to ESC/P2 raster data
- Generate printer maintenance commands (nozzle checks, cleaning)
- Decode ESC/P2 commands into human-readable format
- Preview generated images before printing
- Direct printing support via LPR protocol (if pyprintlpr module is installed)
