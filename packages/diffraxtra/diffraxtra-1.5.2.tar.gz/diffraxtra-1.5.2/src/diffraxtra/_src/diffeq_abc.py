    This is a convenience wrapper around `diffrax.diffeqsolve`, allowing for
    pre-configuration of a `diffrax.AbstractSolver`,
    `diffrax.AbstractStepSizeController`, `diffrax.AbstractAdjoint`, and
    ``max_steps``. Pre-configuring these objects can be useful when you want to:

    - repeatedly solve similar differential equations and can reuse the same
       solver and associated settings.
    - pass the differential equation solver as an argument to a function.

    Note that for some `diffrax.SaveAt` options, `max_steps=None` can be
    incompatible. In such cases, you can override the `max_steps` argument when
    calling the `DiffEqSolver` object.
