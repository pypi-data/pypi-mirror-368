## The CleverMiner is an enhanced association rule mining library 

Beyond apriori. CleverMiner is the package for enhanced association rule mining (eARM), that are INTERPRETABLE, so by definition   one of few intrinsic methods of explainable AI (XAI). Comparing to standard association rules, it is very enhanced, because the package implements the GUHA procedures that generalizes apriori and association rules in many ways. Rules are based on categorical data that can be easily visualized and interpreted. Their if-then with probability allows easy deployment by human realized processes. Truly interpretable & explainable knowledge mining.

## The CleverMiner in more detail

In general, apriori is looking for rules {ItemSet} -> {Item} (Base, prob). GUHA goes further and instead of items (boolean attributes), list of categorial attributes and combination of values (nominal and several strategies for ordinal -- joining categories) is searched on left and right hand side. Moreover, GUHA has much more possibilites and several other procedures, like mining interesting histograms, finding couples of rules etc.

To run cleverminer procedures, use dataframe with categorical variables only. Cleverminer prepares all variables and values for future reuse.

## Optimized in many ways

CleverMiner has optimized space search in several ways. 

- first, it encodes dataframe into internal format that is optimized for frequent querying for similar pattern, then it queries the dataframe many (typically several thousand or tens/hunderds thousand) times. 
- the algorithm has also optimizations by the derived properties of individual procedures (e.g. when procedure A finds that expanding rule will in every case lead into rules that does not meet requirements, it skips entire branch). This optimization typically reduces the mining time significantly.

1.0.1
 - new procedures get4fold, gethist, getquantifiers, getrulecount

1.0.0 - Major release, major rebuild from all views:
 - data import reworked and fastened significantly
 - much faster calculation (rule mining) in Py3.10 + next optimizations for rule mining are in place
 - output structure is enhanced, fully structured output is available for post-processing (trace_cedent, cedent_struct in output)
 - data can be read once and multiple tasks can be performed (.mine method)
 - optimizations for sd4ft miner
 - verbosity options available (run progress output has been changed)

0.0.91 - detect error in datatypes in input data and correctly report it

0.0.90 - fix in displaying rules for 4ft-Miner, in CF-Miner: allowing relmax to be bounded from both sides (leq introduced), in SD4ft-Miner: allowing ratioconf to be bounded from both sides (leq introduced)

0.0.89 - quantifiers and output dictionary names change in favor of rules terminology (output: hypotheses->rules; hypo_id -> rule_id, quantifiers kept 
for compatibility old and new names, including variability (like frstbase -> also base1 is possible)
