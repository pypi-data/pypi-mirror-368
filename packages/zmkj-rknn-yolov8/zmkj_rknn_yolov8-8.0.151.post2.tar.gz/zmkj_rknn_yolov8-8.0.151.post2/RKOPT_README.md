## Description - export optimized model for RKNPU

### 1. Model structure Adjustment

- The dfl structure has poor performance on NPU processing, moved outside the model.

   Assuming that there are 6000 candidate frames, the original model places the dfl structure before the "box confidence filter", then the 6000 candidate frames need to be calculated through dfl calculation. If the dfl structure is placed after the "box confidence filter", Assuming that there are 100 candidate boxes left after filtering, the calculation amount of the dfl part is reduced to 100, which greatly reduces the occupancy of computing resources and bandwidth resources.



- Assuming that there are 6000 candidate boxes and the detection category is 80, the threshold retrieval operation needs to be repeated 6000* 80 ~= 4.8*10^5 times, which takes a lot of time. Therefore, when exporting the model, an additional summation operation for 80 types of detection targets is added to the model to quickly filter the confidence. (This structure is effective in some cases, related to the training results of the model)

  You can comment out this part of the optimization at line 52 to line 54 of **ultralytics/nn/modules/head.py**, and the corresponding code is:

```
cls_sum = torch.clamp(y[-1].sum(1, keepdim=True), 0, 1)
y.append(cls_sum)
```




- (optional) In fact, if the user refers to the structure of yolov5, the output of 80 categories is adjusted to 80+1 category, and the newly added category 1 is used as the confidence level of the control box, which acts as a filter. In this way, the post-processing can reduce the number of logical judgments by 10 to 40 times when the CPU executes the threshold judgment.



### 2. Export model operation

After meeting the environmental requirements of ./requirements.txt, execute the following statement to export the model

```
# Adjust the model file path in ./ultralytics/cfg/default.yaml, the default is yolov8n.pt, if you train the model yourself, please transfer to the corresponding path

export PYTHONPATH=./
python ./ultralytics/engine/exporter.py

After execution, the _rknnopt.torchscript model will be generated. If the original model is yolov8n.pt, generate the yolov8n_rknnopt.torchscript model.
```



Export Code Changes Explained

- In ./ultralytics/cfg/default.yaml, there is a parameter **format** for exporting the model format, and the support for 'rknn' has been added
- When the model is inferred to Detect Head, format=='rknn' takes effect, dfl and post-processing are skipped,
- It should be noted that this repository has not tested the optimization method of pose head and segment head, which is currently not supported. You can try to change it yourself if needed.
