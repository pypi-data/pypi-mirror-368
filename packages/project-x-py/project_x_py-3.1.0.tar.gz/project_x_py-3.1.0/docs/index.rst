**project-x-py** is a high-performance **async Python SDK** for the `ProjectX Trading Platform <https://www.projectx.com/>`_ Gateway API. This library enables developers to build sophisticated trading strategies and applications by providing comprehensive async access to futures trading operations, real-time market data, Level 2 orderbook analysis, and a complete technical analysis suite with 55+ TA-Lib compatible indicators.

.. note::
   **Version 3.0.0**: Complete async architecture with EventBus integration for unified event handling. All components now use factory functions and dependency injection patterns. Enterprise-grade error handling with centralized logging and comprehensive retry mechanisms.

.. warning::
   **Development Phase**: This project is under active development. New updates may introduce breaking changes without backward compatibility. During this development phase, we prioritize clean, modern code architecture over maintaining legacy implementations.

.. note::
   **Important**: This is a **client library/SDK**, not a trading strategy. It provides the tools and infrastructure to help developers create their own trading strategies that integrate with the ProjectX platform.

Quick Start
-----------

Install the package::

   uv add project-x-py

Or with pip::

   pip install project-x-py

Set up your credentials::

   export PROJECT_X_API_KEY='your_api_key'
   export PROJECT_X_USERNAME='your_username'

Start trading::

   import asyncio
   from project_x_py import ProjectX
   from project_x_py.indicators import RSI, SMA, MACD
   
   async def main():
       # V3: Create client with async context manager
       async with ProjectX.from_env() as client:
           await client.authenticate()
           
           # Get market data with technical analysis
           data = await client.get_bars('MNQ', days=30, interval=60)  # V3: actual symbol
           data = RSI(data, period=14)         # Add RSI
           data = SMA(data, period=20)         # Add moving average
           data = MACD(data)                   # Add MACD
           
           # V3: Place an order with JWT authentication
           from project_x_py import create_order_manager, create_realtime_client
           instrument = await client.get_instrument('MNQ')
           
           # V3: Create realtime client with JWT and account ID
           realtime_client = await create_realtime_client(
               jwt_token=client.jwt_token,
               account_id=str(client.account_id)
           )
           order_manager = create_order_manager(client, realtime_client)
           
           response = await order_manager.place_limit_order(
               contract_id=instrument.id, 
               side=0, 
               size=1, 
               limit_price=21050.0  # V3: realistic MNQ price
           )
   
   # Run the async function
   asyncio.run(main())
