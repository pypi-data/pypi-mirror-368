   - The generated training data and scripts can be used in other environments.
   - The pickle file is ready for API development with the included test script.

## Limitations
- **Community Edition**:
  - Supports only regression and classification problems.
  - Works exclusively with scikit-learn algorithms.
  - Operates as a local API accessed via the [ML Bot Portal](https://zohencelai.github.io/MLBot).
  - Limited by data size and training time.

- **Prime Edition**:
  - Offers advanced features, including custom training logic and access to a wider range of algorithms.
  - Provides enhanced integration capabilities and overcomes limitations of the community edition.
## 2) AI Voice Assistant

The `VoiceAssistant` in `Zohencel-AI` provides a customizable, voice-enabled assistant that listens to user input, processes it, and responds with spoken text. Designed to be adaptable, the assistants attributesâ€”such as name, tone, purpose, and voice typeâ€”can be tailored to fit a wide range of use cases, making it suitable for personalized or business-focused applications.

### Key Customizations
- **Assistant Name**: Set a unique name for the assistant, making interactions feel more personalized and relatable.
- **User Name**: Personalize responses by specifying the userâ€™s name, enhancing engagement.
- **Tone and Duty**: Define the assistantâ€™s tone and duty with an optional description. For example, set it as a "helpful and friendly guide" or an "informative support assistant" to adjust the assistant's personality.
- **Voice Type**: Choose between a â€˜maleâ€™ or â€˜femaleâ€™ voice to best suit the assistant's character and user preferences.

### Usage Example

Here's how to configure these options when creating and running your assistant:

```python
from zohencel_ai import VoiceAssistant

# Initialize the VoiceAssistant
assistant = VoiceAssistant()

# Run the assistant with custom settings
assistant.run(
    voice='female',                # Voice type: 'female' or 'male'
    assistant_name='Zohencel',     # Assistant's name
    user_name='Alex',              # User's name for personalized responses
    description='I am here as your friendly and reliable AI guide.'  # Assistant's tone and purpose
)
```
- all the parameters are optional and you can just run it by calling assistant.run() 


# 3) Chart Bot 

**Chart Bot** is your ultimate data companion! Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned professional, this intelligent tool simplifies the process of understanding, querying, and visualizing your data. Designed with accessibility and functionality in mind, Chart Bot empowers users to harness the full potential of their data without the steep learning curve of advanced libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.  

---
Start using **Chart Bot** with just a few lines of code:  

```python
from zohencel_ai.analysis import Analysischartbot

bot = Analysischartbot()
bot.run()
```

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Upload Your Data**: Provide your dataset in a compatible format (CSV, Excel, etc.).
2. **Query the Data**: Use intuitive commands to filter, analyze, and understand your data.
3. **Visualize**: Create stunning charts and graphs to uncover trends and distributions.
4. **Preprocess**: Execute essential ML preprocessing tasks with built-in tools.
5. **Limitations**: Memory context is not available in the current version, it will be in the upcoming version.So provide the query in full contetxt.
