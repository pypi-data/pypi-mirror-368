## How to Use

To use this project, you go into the server, and enter in the command, /stats and then fill out the name field and query field. For the name, just put the username of the minecraft acount you want to check. For the query, type whatever stat you want to view. It will show the top suggestions for what you are trying to view, so if you type "skywars team" it will show you the skywars team stats.
