This module adds a set of financial reports. They are accessible under
Invoicing / Reporting / OCA accounting reports.

Currently General ledger, Trial Balance and Open Items are fully compatible with a foreign
currency set up in account in order to display balances. Moreover, any foreign
currency used in account move lines is properly shown.

In case that in an account has not been configured a second currency foreign
currency balances are not available.

In the Trial Balance, the flag *Hide accounts with 0 end balance*
allows the user to hide accounts that
have ending balance equal to 0 in the selected period.
