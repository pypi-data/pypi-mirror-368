# StraceTools 🔍

**A modern Python library for parsing, analyzing, and visualizing strace output with ease.**

If you find our library useful, please consider starring ⭐ the repository or citing it in your projects! Your support helps us continue improving StraceTools.


## Why StraceTools? 🚀

System debugging and performance analysis often rely on [strace](https://strace.io/) to understand application behavior. However, existing tools typically fall short:

- **Limited scope**: Most tools only provide basic statistics or file access lists
- **No programmability**: Fixed output formats with no API for custom analysis
- **Poor multi-threading support**: Difficult to analyze concurrent syscall execution
- **No visualization**: Raw text output is hard to interpret for complex applications

**StraceTools bridges these gaps** by providing:

✨ **Comprehensive parsing** with full syscall detail extraction  
🔧 **Programmable API** for custom analysis workflows  
📊 **Interactive visualizations** for timeline and process analysis  
🧵 **Multi-threading support** with process relationship tracking  

## Quick Start 🏃‍♂️

### Getting `strace` Output
To use StraceTools, you first need to generate `strace` output from your application. You can do this by running:

```bash
strace -f -tt -T <other options> -o app_strace.out <your_application>
```

#### Sample Data
You can find some sample strace output in the `examples` directory, they are generated using the following command:
- ls.strace.out: `strace -f -tt -T -s 16 -x -a 40 -o examples/ls.strace.out ls -al /`


### Installation
You can install StraceTools directly from PyPI using pip:
```bash
pip install stracetools
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from stracetools import StraceParser, StraceAnalyzer

# Parse strace output
parser = StraceParser()
events = parser.parse_file("app_strace.out")

# Analyze the results
analyzer = StraceAnalyzer(events)

# Quick insights
print(f"Processes: {len(analyzer.get_pids())}")
print(f"Syscalls: {len(analyzer.get_syscall_names())}")
print(f"Duration: {analyzer.events[-1].timestamp - analyzer.events[0].timestamp}")

# Brief overview
print(analyzer.summary())
```

## Roadmap 🗺️

### Current Status ✅
- [x] Complete strace parsing with multi-threading support
- [x] Comprehensive filtering and analysis API
- [x] Rich statistics and insights
- [x] Interactive timeline Gantt charts
- [x] Process activity visualization
- [x] Official publication on PyPI
- [x] Lazy, chainable query interface  -- since v0.2.0


### Coming Soon 🚧
- [ ] **Export to CSV/JSON** for further analysis

- [ ] **Complete visualization suite** (frequency charts, duration histograms)
- [ ] **Integration with profiling tools**

## Requirements 📋

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Core dependencies**: None (pure Python)
- **Visualization** (optional): `matplotlib>=3.5`, `plotly>=5.0`, `numpy>=1.20`

## Contributing 🤝

We welcome contributions! Whether it's:

- 🐛 **Bug reports** and feature requests
- 📖 **Documentation** improvements  
- 🔧 **Code contributions** (parsing improvements, new analysis methods)
- 📊 **Visualization enhancements**


## Key Features 🛠️

### 🎯 **Easy Parsing**

```python
# Initialize parser
parser = StraceParser()

# Parse strace output from a string
event = parser.parse_string("52806 11:11:17.955673 nanosleep({tv_sec=0, tv_nsec=20000}, NULL) = 0 <0.000102>")

# Parse strace output file
events = parser.parse_file("app_strace.out")

```

### 📊 **Rich Statistics**

```python
# Initialize analyzer with parsed events
analyzer = StraceAnalyzer(events)

# Get all PIDs
pids = analyzer.get_pids()

# Get all syscall names
syscall_names = analyzer.get_syscall_names()

# Process information
process_info = analyzer.get_process_info(1234)
print(f"Runtime: {process_info.last_seen - process_info.first_seen}")
print(f"Syscalls: {process_info.syscall_count}")
print(f"CPU time: {process_info.total_duration:.3f}s")

# Syscall statistics
read_stats = analyzer.get_syscall_stats("read")
print(f"Average read duration: {read_stats.avg_duration:.6f}s")
print(f"Error rate: {read_stats.error_count / read_stats.count:.1%}")

# Top syscalls by frequency or duration
top_frequent = analyzer.get_top_syscalls(10, by='count')
top_expensive = analyzer.get_top_syscalls(10, by='duration')

# Timeline analysis
timeline = analyzer.get_timeline_summary(bucket_size=timedelta(seconds=1))
```

### 🔍 **Powerful Filtering and Analysis**

<details>
<summary> 
Individual Filters (before v0.2.0)
</summary>

```python
# Filter by process
events_1234 = analyzer.by_pid(1234)

# Filter by syscall with argument matching
file_reads = analyzer.filter_by_syscall("read", args=["file.txt"])

# Filter by event type of signals
signal_events = analyzer.filter_by_event_type(TraceEventType.SIGNAL)

# Time-based filtering
recent_events = analyzer.filter_by_time_range(start_time, end_time)

# Performance analysis
error_calls = analyzer.filter_with_errors()
slow_calls = analyzer.filter_slow_calls(0.01)  # > 10ms
```
</details>

#### Chainable Queries (since v0.2.0)

```python
# Chainable filtering example
filtered_events = (
    analyzer.query()
    .by_pid(1234)  # Filter by specific PID
    .by_syscall_name(SyscallGroups.FILE_IO) # Filter by syscall group
    .with_success() # Only successful syscalls
    .collect(sort_by_timestamp=True) # Collect results
)
```

A list of available query methods is:

- `by_pid(pids: int | Collection[int])` - Filter events by one or more PIDs.
- `by_syscall_name(names: str | Collection[str])` - Filter events by one or more syscall names.
- `by_syscall_args(required_args: list[str])` - Filter events by required arguments in syscall.
- `by_type(event_type: TraceEventType)` - Filter events by their type (e.g., SYSCALL, SIGNAL, EXIT).
- `by_time_range(start: datetime, end: datetime)` - Filter events that occurred within a specific time range.
- `with_errors()` - Filter events that resulted in an error (i.e., have a non-null error_msg).
- `with_success()` - Filter events that were successful (i.e., have a null error_msg).
- `slow_calls(min_duration: float)` - Filter events that took longer than a specified duration (in seconds).
- `by_filename_regex(pattern: str)` - Filter events by matching the filename against a regex pattern.


### 📈 **Interactive Visualizations** *(Partial - In Progress)*

```python
visualizer = StraceVisualizer(analyzer, color_map_file="default_colors.json", auto_fillup=False)

# Interactive Gantt chart timeline
gantt_fig = visualizer.plot_timeline_gantt(
    pids=[1234, 5678],              # Filter specific processes
    syscalls=["read", "write"],     # Filter specific syscalls
    max_events=4000,                # Limit for performance
)
gantt_fig.write_html("gantt.html")

# Process activity timeline  
activity_fig = visualizer.plot_process_activity()
activity_fig.show()
```
