### A module for mangling biomolecules
---
AldePYde is a module of spite. Being frustrated with either the lack of obscure potential or the difficult and steep learning curve of other similar modules,
I made this. Here I present my various tools for chem/bioinformatics. This is all very much a work-in-progress, especially as I move over functionality from my
[deprecated module.](https://github.com/cathepsin/apalib)

Documentation to come soon ðŸŽ‰
