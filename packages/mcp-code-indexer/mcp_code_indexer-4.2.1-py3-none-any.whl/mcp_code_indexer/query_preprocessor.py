"""
Query preprocessing module for intelligent FTS5 search.

This module provides intelligent query preprocessing for SQLite FTS5 full-text search
to enable multi-word search with case insensitive matching, whole word enforcement,
and proper handling of FTS5 operators as literal search terms.

Key features:
- Multi-word queries: "grpc proto" becomes "grpc" AND "proto" for
  order-agnostic matching
- FTS5 operator escaping: "AND OR" becomes '"AND" AND "OR"' to treat
  operators as literals
- Whole word matching: prevents partial matches by relying on proper tokenization
- Case insensitive: leverages FTS5 default behavior
- Special character handling: preserves special characters in quoted terms
