The installation of the &FGA; package follows standard &GAP; rules.
So the standard method is to unpack the archive into the <C>pkg</C>
directory  of your &GAP; distribution.  This will create an <C>fga</C>
subdirectory. 
<P/>
For other non-standard options please see Chapter&nbsp;<Ref BookName="ref"
Sect="Installing a GAP Package"/> in the &GAP; Reference Manual.

The &FGA; package is configured to autoload, so its functionality is
usually available once &GAP; is started.
<P/>
If &GAP; does not autoload, you can request the package with the
<C>LoadPackage</C> command like this:
