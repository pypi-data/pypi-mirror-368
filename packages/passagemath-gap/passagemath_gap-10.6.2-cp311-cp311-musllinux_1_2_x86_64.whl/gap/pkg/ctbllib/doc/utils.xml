<Heading>Utility Functions Provided by the <Package>CTblLib</Package>
Package</Heading>

This chapter describes &GAP; functions that are provided by the
<Package>CTblLib</Package> package but that might be of general interest.

<P/>

For the moment, there are just two features to describe,
the generation of &ATLAS; irrationalities from cyclotomic integers
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:CTblLib.StringOfAtlasIrrationality"/>),
and the generation of information about the group structure from
identifiers of character tables
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:StructureDescriptionCharacterTableName"/>).
