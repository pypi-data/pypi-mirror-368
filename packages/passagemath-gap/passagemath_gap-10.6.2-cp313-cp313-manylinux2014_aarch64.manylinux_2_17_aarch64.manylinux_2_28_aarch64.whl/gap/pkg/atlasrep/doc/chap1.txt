  [33X[0;0YThe  aim  of the [5XGAP[105XÂ 4 package [5XAtlasRep[105X is to provide a link between [5XGAP[105X and
  databases such as the [5XATLAS[105X of Group Representations [WWT+], which comprises
  generating  permutations  and  matrices  for  many almost simple groups, and
  information  about  their  maximal  subgroups.  This  database  is available
  independent of [5XGAP[105X at[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[7Xhttp://atlas.math.rwth-aachen.de/Atlas/v3[107X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XAtlasRep[105X  package consists of this database (see SectionÂ [14X1.1[114X) and a [5XGAP[105X
  interface  (see  SectionÂ [14X1.2[114X); the latter is extended by further information
  available via the internet (see SectionÂ [14X4.3[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis package manual has the following parts.[133X
  
  [8XA tutorial[108X
        [33X[0;6Ygives  an  overview  how the functions of the package can be used, see
        ChapterÂ [14X2[114X.[133X
  
  [8XUser interface functions[108X

  [8XInformation how to extend the database[108X
        [33X[0;6Ycan be found in ChapterÂ [14X5[114X.[133X
  
  [8XMore technical information[108X
        [33X[0;6Ycan  be  found  in  the  chaptersÂ [14X6[114X  (concerning  [5XGAP[105X objects that are
        introduced  by  the  package)  andÂ [14X7[114X  (concerning global variables and

  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YThe [5XATLAS[105X[101X[1X of Group Representations[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe [5XATLAS[105X of Group Representations Â [WWT+] consists of matrices over various
  rings, permutations, and shell scripts encoding so-called black box programs
  (see  [Nic06]  and  SectionÂ [14X6.2[114X).  Many  of  these scripts are straight line
  programs  (seeÂ [BSWW01],  [SWW00],  andÂ [14X'Reference: Straight Line Programs'[114X)
  and straight line decisions (see SectionÂ [14X6.1[114X). These programs can be used to
  compute  certain  elements  in  a  group  [22XG[122X  from  its  standard  generators
  (seeÂ [Wil96] and SectionÂ [14X3.3[114X) for example generators of maximal subgroups of
  [22XG[122X or representatives of conjugacy classes of [22XG[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe [5XATLAS[105X of Group Representations has been prepared by Robert Wilson, Peter
  Walsh, Jonathan Tripp, Ibrahim Suleiman, Richard Parker, Simon Norton, Simon
  Nickerson,   Steve   Linton,  John  Bray,  and  Rachel  Abbott  (in  reverse
  alphabetical order).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  information  was  computed  and composed using computer algebra systems
  such  as  [5XMeatAxe[105X  (seeÂ [Rin]),  Magma  (seeÂ [CP96]),  and  [5XGAP[105X  (in reverse
  alphabetical  order).  Part of the constructions have been documented in the
  literature  on  almost  simple groups, or the results have been used in such
  publications,  see  for  example  the  bibliographies inÂ [CCN+85] andÂ [BN95]
  which             are             available             online            at

  [33X[0;0YIf  your  work  made use of functions of the [5XGAP[105X interface (see SectionÂ [14X1.2[114X)
  then you should also reference this interface, using the information printed

  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XGAP[105X  interface  to  the  [5XATLAS[105X  of  Group  Representations  consists of
  essentially two parts.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFirst,  there  is  the  [13Xuser interface[113X which allows the user to get an
        overview  of  the  contents of the database, and to access the data in
        [5XGAP[105X  format;  this  is  described in ChapterÂ [14X3[114X. Advanced users may add
        their own data to the database, this is described in ChapterÂ [14X5[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YSecond,  there  is [13Xadministrational information[113X, which covers also the
        declaration  of  [5XGAP[105X objects such as straight line decisions and black
        box  programs.  This  is  important mainly for users interested in the
        actual  implementation  (e.Â g., for modifying the package) or in using
        it  together  with  the  [10XC[110X-[5XMeatAxe[105X  standalone  (seeÂ [Rin]);  this  is
        described in ChapterÂ [14X7[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YInformation  concerning  the  [10XC[110X-[5XMeatAxe[105X,  including the manualÂ [Rin], can be

  [33X[0;0YThe  interface  and  this manual have been provided by Thomas Breuer, except
  for  the  interpreter for black box programs (see SectionÂ [14X6.2[114X), which is due
  to  Simon  Nickerson.  Comments,  bug  reports,  and hints for improving the

  [1X1.3 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in [5XAtlasRep[105X[101X[1X, Compared to Older Versions?[133X[101X
  
  
  [1X1.3-1 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 2.1.9? (August 2024)[133X[101X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YNow  prescribing  a  ring  in  [2XAllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos[102X  ([14X3.5-7[114X) and
        related  functions  automatically prescribes its characteristic. Up to
        now,   one   had   to   specify  also  the  characteristic,  otherwise
        characteristic zero was erroneously assumed.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YUp  to  now, [2XAllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos[102X ([14X3.5-7[114X) and related functions,
        when  called  only  with a prescribed ring in positive characteristic,
        could   erroneously  return  also  entries  about  representations  in
        characteristic zero.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  default  for  the  user  preference  [10X"AtlasRepDataDirectory"[110X (see
        Section  [14X4.2-2[114X)  has  been improved in the situation where the package
        directory  is  not  writable  [13Xand[113X  the [5XGAP[105X session runs inside a [5XJulia[105X
        session;  if this is the case then a [5XJulia[105X scratchspace is used as the
        default.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe   star  [10X*[110X  that  may  appear  in  some  lines  of  the  output  of
        [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X  ([14X3.5-1[114X)  is  now documented. Thanks to Will Chen for
        reporting that an explanation for it was missing.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3-2 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 2.1.8? (January 2024)[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn  example  in Section [14X2.1-2[114X of the Tutorial had to be adjusted because the
  results  of  the function [2XSmallerDegreePermutationRepresentation[102X ([14XReference:
  SmallerDegreePermutationRepresentation[114X)  depend  on  random computations, in
  particular  the  implementation in [5XGAP[105X 4.13 may yield a nicer representation
  than had been shown before.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3-3 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 2.1.7? (August 2023)[133X[101X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YRequesting  certain matrix groups in characteristic zero had caused an
        error  in version 2.1.6, provided that the feature to store downloaded
        files  was  disabled,  that  is,  the  value  of  the  user preference
        [10X"AtlasRepDataDirectory"[110X  (see Section [14X4.2-2[114X) was an empty string. This
        bug is now fixed. Thanks to Lixin Zheng for reporting this problem.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  name  of a maximal subgroup of the group [22XM_12.2[122X had to be changed
        from  [10X"D8.(S4x2)"[110X  to  [10X"2^3.(S4Ã—2)"[110X  because  the old name suggested a
        wrong  group structure. This bug had been announced in a StackExchange
        discussion
        ([7Xhttps://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4577016/group-names-in-gap-character-table-library[107X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YA  typo  in  the documentation of [10XAGR.MXS[110X (see Section [14X7.8[114X) was fixed.
        Thanks to Max Horn for spotting this.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[5XGAP[105X  4.13 will provide the new [21Xpackage extension[121X feature, which allows
        a  package  to  execute  [5XGAP[105X  code  [13Xafter[113X  the  package and some other
        required  packages  have been loaded. In [5XAtlasRep[105X, this feature is now
        used for example in order to achieve that those functions which depend
        on the [5XBrowse[105X package can be used also if this package gets (installed
        and) loaded after [5XAtlasRep[105X has been loaded.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  code  for  building  the  documentation  of  the package has been
        adjusted        to        a       change       in       [5XGAP[105X       4.13
        ([7Xhttps://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/5178[107X).  This  does  not affect
        most users of the package because the package archive contains a ready
        documentation.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3-4 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 2.1.6? (October 2022)[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  package  now requires the [5Xutils[105X package [BGH+22], and uses its [2XDownload[102X
  ([14XUtils:  Download[114X)  function  for  downloading remote files. The former user
  preference  [10XFileTransferTool[110X of the [5XAtlasRep[105X package is no longer supported;
  it had been used in older versions to distinguish between different download
  tools.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  method  for  [2XConjugacyClasses[102X ([14XReference: ConjugacyClasses attribute[114X) has
  been   added   that  uses  a  straight  line  program  for  computing  class
  representatives  of  a  group that has been created with [2XAtlasGroup[102X ([14X3.5-8[114X),
  provided  such a program is available. Thanks to Frank LÃ¼beck for suggesting
  this.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3-5 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 2.1.5? (August 2022)[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YTwo  bugs  concerning  local  file  permissions and the handling of download
  failures  were  fixed.  Thanks  to  Frank  LÃ¼beck  and  Fabian  Zickgraf for
  reporting these problems.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3-6 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 2.1.4? (August 2022)[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YA few changes in the code for downloading files were needed in order to make
  some CI tests happy.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe server address for the core part of the database has changed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAdditional  table  of  contents  files  are  now  available,  which  contain
  checksums  in  SHA256  format  instead  of the checksums computed by [2XCrcFile[102X
  ([14XReference:  CrcFile[114X)  and  [2XCrcString[102X  ([14XReference: CrcString[114X). Note that the

  [33X[0;0YFor  [22X364[122X  representations, the corresponding characters have been identified
  and   can   thus   be   used   for   accessing  these  representations  with

  [33X[0;0YNot much.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  release  of  VersionÂ 2.1.2 was necessary for technical reasons: Now the
  testfile  mentioned  in [11XPackageInfo.g[111X exits [5XGAP[105X in the end, and the external
  links   in   the   package   documentation  were  corrected  (the  links  in
  versionÂ 2.1.1 pointed to a wrong directory).[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3-9 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 2.1.1? (February 2022)[133X[101X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  new function [2XEvaluatePresentation[102X ([14X3.5-11[114X) computes the images of
        the relators of a presentation (see Section [14X6.1-7[114X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe new function [2XStandardGeneratorsData[102X ([14X3.5-12[114X) allows one to compute
        standard  generators from given generators, provided a recipe for that
        task  (a  [21Xfind[121X  straight  line  program)  for the group in question is
        available.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe function [2XAtlasGroup[102X ([14X3.5-8[114X) sets known information about the group
        and the representation, such as [2XIsPrimitive[102X ([14XReference: IsPrimitive[114X).[133X
  
        [33X[0;6Y(Thanks to Steve Linton for suggesting this feature.)[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  function  [2XResultOfBBoxProgram[102X  ([14X6.2-4[114X)  now  admits  an  optional
        argument,  which  is used as options record in calls to [2XRunBBoxProgram[102X
        ([14X6.2-3[114X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  new  user  preference  [10X"AtlasRepJsonFilesAddresses"[110X  (see Section
        [14X4.2-14[114X)   allows  one  to  use  Json  format  data  files  for  matrix
        representations  in  characteristic  zero,  which  in  turn  makes  it
        possible  to  create  the matrices over prescribed fields, for example
        fields returned by [2XAlgebraicExtension[102X ([14XReference: AlgebraicExtension[114X).
        The  information  stored in the table of contents file about the field
        of  entries  of  the matrix representations has been extended by a [5XGAP[105X
        independent description of this field and the defining polynomial used
        in the Json format data files.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YWhen  the  value  of the user preference [10X"AtlasRepDataDirectory"[110X is an
        empty  string then data files that are fetched from remote servers are
        read  into the [5XGAP[105X session without storing the files. (An advantage is
        that  one  need  not  care about where one has permissions for storing
        files.  A disadvantage is of course that one has to fetch a file again
        whenever it is needed.)[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3-10 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 2.1.0? (May 2019)[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe main differences to earlier versions concern extensions of the available
  data.  Up  to  now, such extensions were possible only in the sense that one
  could  notify  certain  [13Xlocally  available files[113X to the package's functions.
  With  this version, it becomes possible to notify also [13Xremote data files[113X, i.
  e., data files which have to be downloaded before they can be read into [5XGAP[105X,
  in  the  same  way  as the data from the [5XATLAS[105X of Group Representations. Two
  extensions  of  this  kind  become automatically available with this package
  version, see Section [14X5.1[114X for details.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThus  the focus of the package has changed. In earlier versions, it provided
  a  [5XGAP[105X  interface to the data in the [5XATLAS[105X of Group Representations, whereas
  now  this  database  is  regarded  as  one  collection (the [21Xcore part[121X) among
  others.  Where  applicable,  the package manual tries to distinguish between
  general data available to the [5XAtlasRep[105X functions and the data from the [5XATLAS[105X
  of Group Representations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  order to provide this new functionality, the following changes have been
  implemented.  Note that some are [13Xincompatible changes[113X, compared with earlier
  versions of the package.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  format  of  the  [10Xidentifier[110X components of the records returned by
        [2XAtlasGenerators[102X  ([14X3.5-3[114X), [2XAtlasProgram[102X ([14X3.5-4[114X), etc., has been changed
        for  those data that belong to extensions, see [14X7.7[114X. In the new format,
        the  name  of  the extension is not added to the group name but to the
        individual filenames; this allows for example the combination of files
        from  the  core  database  and  from  extensions  in  one  identifier.
        Functions  for  converting  between  the  old  and  the new format are
        available, see [2XAtlasRepIdentifier[102X ([14X7.7-1[114X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  records  returned  by [2XAtlasGenerators[102X ([14X3.5-3[114X) etc. contain also a
        component  [10Xcontents[110X,  with  value  the  identifier  of the part of the
        database to shich the generators belong.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  tables  of  contents of the [5XATLAS[105X of Group Representations and of
        extensions  are  no longer stored in the form of sequences of calls to
        [5XGAP[105X  functions.  Instead, each table of contents is defined via a JSON
        format  file,  see [14X6.4[114X. In particular, the file [11Xatlasprm.json[111X replaces
        the former [11Xgap/atlasprm.g[111X.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YTwo  advantages  of  this  change  are that there is no danger to call
        unwanted  [5XGAP[105X  functions  when  such  files  (which are expected to be
        available  in  the  world  wide  web)  get  evaluated,  and  that  the
        information  is independent of [5XGAP[105X â€“note that [5XMeatAxe[105X format files and
        straight line programs can be used by other program systems as well.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  functions  [10XReloadAtlasTableOfContents[110X, [10XStoreAtlasTableOfContents[110X,
        and [10XReplaceAtlasTableOfContents[110X are no longer available. They had been
        intended  for  updating  the  table  of contents of the [5XATLAS[105X of Group
        Representations,  but  it  has  turned  out  that this was in fact not
        useful.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe second major change concerns the handling of user parameters.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[5XGAP[105X's   general  [13Xuser  preferences[113X  mechanism  (see  [2XSetUserPreference[102X
        ([14XReference:  SetUserPreference[114X))  has been used since version 1.5.1 of
        the  package  for  dealing  with  certain customizations of [5XAtlasRep[105X's
        behaviour,  concerning  the  paths  of data directories and two issues
        with [5XMeatAxe[105X format files.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YNow  this  mechanism  is  used  in  more cases, see Section [14X4.2[114X for an
        overview.  The  new user preferences replace certain components of the
        record  [2XAtlasOfGroupRepresentationsInfo[102X  ([14X7.1-5[114X) that were recommended
        in  earlier  versions  of  the package. These components are currently
        still  available  but  are  no longer used by the package's functions.
        Also  the global variable [10XATLASREP_TOCFILE[110X is no longer supported, use
        the  user  preference  [10XAtlasRepTOCData[110X  instead,  see  Section  [14X4.2-3[114X.
        Analogously, use the user preference [10XHowToReadMeatAxeTextFiles[110X instead
        of the no longer available [10XCMeatAxe.FastRead[110X.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YThe  switch  to  user preferences is an [13Xincompatible change[113X if you are
        used  to  change  the  values  of  these  components in your code, for
        example  in  your  [11Xgaprc[111X  file,  seeÂ [14X'Reference: The gap.ini and gaprc
        files'[114X. All assignments to these components should be changed to calls
        of [2XSetUserPreference[102X ([14XReference: SetUserPreference[114X).[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YAnother  consequence  of  this  change  is  that  the  former function
        [10XAtlasOfGroupRepresentationsUserParameters[110X  of the package is no longer
        supported, use [2XShowUserPreferences[102X ([14XReference: ShowUserPreferences[114X) or
        [2XBrowseUserPreferences[102X  ([14XBrowse:  BrowseUserPreferences[114X)  with argument
        [10X"AtlasRep"[110X instead.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFinally, the following improvements have been added.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YStraight  line  programs  for computing generators of normal subgroups
        can  now  be  fetched  with  [2XAtlasProgram[102X  ([14X3.5-4[114X), using the argument
        [10X"kernel"[110X.  The  available  programs  of  this  type  are  shown in the
        [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X  ([14X3.5-1[114X)  overview  for  a  group. More than [22X200[122X such
        programs are available in a new data directory [11Xdatapkg[111X of the package.
        If  fact,  this  collection  of  files  is part of an extension of the
        database that is distributed together with the package.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YIn  earlier versions of the package, this kind of information had been
        available only implicitly; it had been stored via [10XAGR.KERPRG[110X, which is
        not supported anymore.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[2XAtlasProgram[102X  ([14X3.5-4[114X)  supports more variants of arguments: [10X"contents"[110X
        can  be  used  to  list  the available data extensions, [10X"contents"[110X and
        [10X"version"[110X  can  be  used to restrict the data under consideration, and
        one  can  request  a program for computing [13Xstandard[113X generators of some
        maximal  subgroup, not just generators (provided that this information
        is available).[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YThe  information  about the version of straight line programs is shown
        by  [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X  ([14X3.5-1[114X), as well as the availability of straight
        line programs for computing standard generators of maximal subgroups.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YMaking  this  information  more  explicit has the side-effect that the
        access   to   the   [5XAtlasRep[105X   data   with   [2XBrowseAtlasInfo[102X  ([14XBrowse:
        BrowseAtlasInfo[114X)  is both safer and simpler, if at least versionÂ 1.8.6
        of   the   [5XBrowse[105X  package  is  available.  (For  that,  the  function
        [10XAGR.InfoPrgs[110X  has  been extended such that also the [10Xidentifier[110X records
        are included in the result.)[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YStraight  line programs for computing [13Xstandard[113X generators of a maximal
        subgroup,  if available, can now be fetched with [2XAtlasProgram[102X ([14X3.5-4[114X),
        using the argument [10X"maxstd"[110X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  function  [2XAtlasRepInfoRecord[102X  ([14X3.5-10[114X) now admits a group name as
        its  argument,  and  then  returns information about the group and its
        maximal   subgroups;   this   information  had  been  used  before  by
        [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X   ([14X3.5-1[114X),  but  it  had  not  been  programmatically
        accessible.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  sanity  checks for the data (see SectionÂ [14X7.9[114X) have been extended,
        in  particular  they  can  be applied also to data extensions. To some
        extent,  these  checks can be used also to derive new information; the
        code  for  that  should  be  regarded  as  heuristic and experimental,
        runtimes  and  space  requirements  may be large, depending on the new
        data to be examined.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YDifferent  header  formats  are now supported when reading and writing
        [5XMeatAxe[105X  format  files,  see  Section  [14X4.2-8[114X, and one can set a global
        default for the creation of mode 2 [5XMeatAxe[105X files, see Section [14X4.2-9[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  function  [2XMeatAxeString[102X  ([14X7.3-2[114X) admits also an integer matrix as
        argument.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe function [2XCMtxBinaryFFMatOrPerm[102X ([14X7.3-4[114X) admits an optional argument
        [3Xbase[103X,  in order to write [5XMeatAxe[105X format files that contain either zero
        based or one based permutations.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  meaningless  lines about [22Xp[122X-modular representations of groups with
        nontrivial [22Xp[122X-core have been removed from the file [11Xgap/mindeg.g[111X.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3-11 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 1.5.1? (March 2016)[133X[101X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  paths  of  the directories where downloaded data files get stored
        are  now  customizable,  see  Section  [14X4.2-2[114X. Up to now, the data were
        stored  in  subdirectories of the package directory, which might cause
        problems  with write permissions, depending on the installation of the
        package. (Note that choosing other data directories can be useful also
        in  order  to keep existing local data files when a new version of [5XGAP[105X
        or  of  the [5XAtlasRep[105X package gets installed.) Thanks to Bill Allombert
        for pointing out this problem.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe   information   about   data   files   from  the  [5XATLAS[105X  of  Group
        Representations  has  been  extended  by  [2XCrcFile[102X ([14XReference: CrcFile[114X)
        values.  These  values  are checked whenever data from such a file are
        read,  and  an  error is signalled if the checksum does not fit to the
        expected  one. Note that several users may access the same data files,
        and  a  user  should not suffer from perhaps corrupted files that have
        been downloaded by other users. Thanks to Frank LÃ¼beck for the idea to
        introduce this consistency test.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YWhenever [2XStringFile[102X ([14XGAPDoc: StringFile[114X) is called by functions of the
        package, this happens in the wrapper function [10XAGR.StringFile[110X, in order
        to  replace  occasional  line  breaks  of  the  form  [10X"\r\n"[110X  by [10X"\n"[110X.
        Apparently  it  may  happen that the [10X"\r"[110X is silently smuggled in when
        data  files  get  copied to the local computer. Thanks to Marek Mitros
        for help with detecting and fixing this problem.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe   function   [2XFFMatOrPermCMtxBinary[102X   ([14X7.3-5[114X)  can  now  read  also
        permutations  stored  in  binary  files  that  have  been created with
        version  2.4 of the C-[5XMeatAxe[105X; note that this format is different from
        the    one    that    is   written   by   version   2.3.   Conversely,
        [2XCMtxBinaryFFMatOrPerm[102X  ([14X7.3-4[114X)  has  been  generalized  such that both
        formats  can  be written. The reference to the C-[5XMeatAxe[105X documentation
        now  points  to  that  of  version  2.4.  Thanks  to JÃ¼rgen MÃ¼ller for
        pointing out this problem.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe function [2XMeatAxeString[102X ([14X7.3-2[114X) can now encode permutation matrices
        in  different  ways. The mode (the first header entry) can be either 2
        (then the positions of the nonzero entries are listed) or 1 or 6 (then
        all  entries  of  the  matrix  are  listed). In previous versions, the
        function  produced  a matrix of mode 2 whenever this was possible, but
        this  behaviour  is  not  useful if the result is not processed by the
        C-[5XMeatAxe[105X. Thanks to Klaus Lux for pointing out this problem.[133X

  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe function [2XAtlasSubgroup[102X ([14X3.5-9[114X) now admits also the return value of

        ([14X3.5-8[114X)  as  its first argument. The latter is implemented via the new
        attribute  [2XAtlasRepInfoRecord[102X  ([14X3.5-10[114X),  which  is  set in the groups
        constructed by [2XAtlasGroup[102X ([14X3.5-8[114X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YInformation   about   transitivity,   rank,   primitivity,  and  point
        stabilizers  of  many permutation representations is now available. If
        applicable  then  this  information appears in the records returned by
        [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X ([14X3.5-6[114X), it is part of the overview shown by

  [30X    [33X[0;6YIn  the  overview  shown  by  [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X) and in the data

        improved such that, e.g., [10X"A9"[110X precedes [10X"A10"[110X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe function [2XAtlasClassNames[102X ([14X3.4-2[114X) now admits also a Brauer table as

  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  information  about the number of maximal subgroups, if available,

        also  generators  of maximal subgroups of downward extensions of [22XG[122X; if
        not  then it may suffice to extend the given straight line programs by
        additional generators.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YCurrently  this  yields  more  than  [22X200[122X  new possibilities to compute
        maximal  subgroups,  this  means  a  growth  by  about [22X25[122X percent. For
        example,  all  maximal  subgroups  of  [22X12.M_22[122X  and [22X2.Fi_22[122X can now be

  [33X[0;0YThis  version  was  mainly  released in order to fix a few problems. Now one
  does not get warnings about unbound variables when the package is loaded and
  the  [5XGAP[105X package [5XIO[105X [Neu14] is not available, and pathological situations in

  files  and  different  byte  orderings  in  binary  files)  are handled more
  carefully.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBesides this, the two functions [2XAtlasGroup[102X ([14X3.5-8[114X) and [2XAtlasSubgroup[102X ([14X3.5-9[114X)

  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  database  was extended, see SectionÂ [14X4.2-4[114X for the number and size
        of files.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YNew data types and corresponding [5XGAP[105X objects have been introduced, for

  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  functions  for actually accessing the data are more flexible now,
        see SectionÂ [14X7.2[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFor transferring remote data, the [5XGAP[105X package [5XIO[105X (see [Neu14]) can now
        be used (and is recommended) as an alternative to [11Xwget[111X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  address  of the data server has changed. The access to the server
        is  no  longer possible via [11Xftp[111X, thus the mechanism used up to version
        1.2, which was based on [11Xftp[111X, had to be rewritten.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YThe  main consequence of this change is that information about updates
        of  the  table  of contents is now provided at the package's homepage.
        This  means that on the one hand, now package users cannot [13Xcompute[113X the
        table of contents directly from the server data, but on the other hand
        the  update  information  can  be  [13Xdownloaded[113X without the necessity to

        [33X[0;6YAnother consequence is that the system program [11Xls[111X is no longer needed,
        see SectionÂ [14X1.3-17[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe package manual has been restructured, extended and improved. It is

  [33X[0;0YNot much.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe release of VersionÂ 1.2 became necessary first of all in order to provide
  a   package   version   that   is   compatible   with  [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.4,  since  some
  cross-references into the [5XGAP[105X Reference Manual were broken due to changes of
  section  names.  Additionally,  several web addresses concerning the package
  itself were changed and thus had to be adjusted.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis opportunity was used[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yto  upgrade  the  administrational part for loading the package to the
        mechanism that is recommended for [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.4,[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yto  extend  the  test  suite, which now covers more consistency checks
        using the [5XGAP[105X Character Table Library (see [Bre22]),[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yto  make  the function [2XScanMeatAxeFile[102X ([14X7.3-1[114X) more robust, due to the
        fact  that the [5XGAP[105X function [2XPermList[102X ([14XReference: PermList[114X) now returns
        [9Xfail[109X instead of raising an error,[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yto  change  the way how representations with prescribed properties are
        accessed  (the  new  function [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X ([14X3.5-6[114X) is now
        preferred     to     the     former     [10XOneAtlasGeneratingSet[110X,     and
        [2XAllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos[102X  ([14X3.5-7[114X) has been added in order to provide
        programmatic  access  in  parallel  to the human readable descriptions
        printed by [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X)),[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yand last but not least to include the current table of contents of the

  [33X[0;0YFor  [5XAtlasRep[105X  users, the new feature of [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.4 is particularly interesting
  that due to better kernel support, reading large matrices over finite fields
  is now faster than it was in [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.3.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3-17 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 1.1? (October 2002)[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe   biggest   change  w.Â r.Â t.Â VersionÂ 1.1  is  the  addition  of  private
  extensions  (see ChapterÂ [14X5[114X). It includes a new [21Xfree format[121X for straight line
  programs  (see SectionÂ [14X5.2[114X). Unfortunately, this feature requires the system
  program  [11Xls[111X,  so  it  may  be  not  available  for  example under MS Windows
  operating systems. [But see SectionÂ [14X1.3-15[114X.][133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn order to admit the addition of other types of data, the implementation of
  several functions has been changed. Data types are described in SectionÂ [14X7.5[114X.
  An  example  of  a  new  data  type  are  quaternionic  representations (see
  SectionÂ [14X7.6[114X). The user interface itself (see ChapterÂ [14X3[114X) remained the same.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  an alternative to [10Xperl[110X, one can use [10Xwget[110X now for transferring data files
  (seeÂ [14X4.2[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YData  files can be read much more efficiently in [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.3 than in [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.2. In
  VersionÂ 1.1  of  the  [5XAtlasRep[105X  package,  this  feature  is used for reading
  matrices  and  permutations  in  [5XMeatAxe[105X  text  format  with [2XScanMeatAxeFile[102X
  ([14X7.3-1[114X).  As  a  consequence,  (at  least)  [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.3 is required for [5XAtlasRep[105X
  VersionÂ 1.1.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe     new     [10Xcompress[110X     component     of     the     global    variable
  [2XAtlasOfGroupRepresentationsInfo[102X  ([14X7.1-5[114X)  allows  one  to  store  data files
  automatically in [11Xgzip[111Xped form.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  matrix  representations  in  characteristic  zero,  invariant forms and
  generators for the centralizer algebra are now accessible in [5XGAP[105X if they are
  contained  in  the  source  files  â€“this  information  had  been  ignored in
  VersionÂ 1.0.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAdditional information is now available via the internet (seeÂ [14X4.3[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe facilities for updating the table of contents have been extended.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  manual  is  now  distributed  also in PDF and HTML format; on the other
  hand, the PostScript format manual is no longer contained in the archives.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YApart  from these changes, a few minor bugs in the handling of [5XMeatAxe[105X files
  have  been  fixed,  typos  in the documentation have been corrected, and the
  syntax checks for [5XATLAS[105X straight line programs (seeÂ [14X7.4[114X) have been improved.[133X
