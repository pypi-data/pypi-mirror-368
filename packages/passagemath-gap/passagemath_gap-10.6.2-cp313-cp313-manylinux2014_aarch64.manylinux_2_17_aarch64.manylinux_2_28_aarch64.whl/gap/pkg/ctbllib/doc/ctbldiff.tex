This list contains the changes in the {\GAP} character table library
since the official upgrade for {\GAP}~3.4 in October 1996.
We denote mathematical errors by {\bf ***} and new information
by {\bf NEW}\null.
We use {\bf C} to denote changes that are not obviously corrections;
the number of these changes is kept small.

{\bf Ordinary Tables}

The following changes affect several ordinary tables.

\medbreak

\halign{\hfil{\bf #}&\quad
 \vtop{\parindent0pt\hsize=43em\strut#\strut}\cr
C&Whitespace at the end of {\tt InfoText} strings was removed.\cr
NEW&Various class fusions were added.\cr
NEW&Components {\tt tomidentifier} and {\tt tomfusion} were added
in order to provide a (preliminary) interface to
the library of tables of marks.\cr
C&In the library tables of alternating and symmetric groups,
the {\tt classtext} components
(partitions parametrizing the conjugacy classes;
in some cases, this had been hidden inside the {\tt CAS}
component of the table)
were replaced by values of the attribute {\tt ClassParameters}.\cr
NEW&The tables of $L_2(q)$ were added for those values of $q$ for which
the table of marks of $L_2(q)$ is now contained in the {\GAP} library.\cr
NEW&In the library tables of symmetric groups,
the partitions parametrizing the irreducible characters
are stored on the tables,
as value of the attribute {\tt CharacterParameters}.\cr
C&The {\tt Identifier} values of a few tables have been changed.
For example, the table of {\tt L4(3).2\^{}2} was previously known only as
{\tt psl(4,3).v4}.
The old names are still valid.\cr
***&The character tables with identifiers {\tt iu332}, {\tt D2MJ4},
and {\tt P4L82} were removed.
The former two tables were incomplete, the latter one was wrong.\cr
NEW&The ordinary tables of all maximal subgroups
(and their class fusions)
are now available for the groups $G_2(3)$, $J_3.2$, $2.M_{12}$,
$M_{12}.2$, $M_{22}.2$, and $O_8^+(3)$.\cr}

$p$-subgroups were added.\cr
C&J_4&:&The classes and the characters of the maximal subgroup of type
$2^{10}\!:\!L_5(2)$ were reordered,
and the identifier was changed from {\tt l52m10} (from the {\CAS} library)
to {\tt 2\^{}10:L5(2)}.\cr
% Make the old table available again, with the old name! (ctomaxi6.tbl)
NEW&McL&:&The table of the seventh maximal subgroup of $McL.2$ was added.\cr
C&O_8^+(2)&:&The classes and the characters of the maximal subgroup of
type $2^6\!:\!A_8$ were reordered,
and the identifier was changed from {\tt mo81p} (from the {\CAS} library) to
{\tt 2\^{}6:A8}.\cr
% Make the old table available again, with the old name! (ctomisc2.tbl)
% The same holds for the table with name `y' ! (ctomisc6.tbl)
C&O_8^+(3)&:&The fusions from $O_7(3)$ and $3^6\!:\!L_4(3)$ were changed
to the ones listed in the Atlas of Finite Groups.\cr
NEW&O_{10}^+(2)&:&The table of the maximal subgroup $2^8\!:\!O_8^+(2)$
was added.\cr

NEW&ON&:&The tables of $3.ON$ mod $11$ and $31$ are now known.\cr
C&ON&:&The tables of $3.ON$ and $3.ON.2$ mod $19$ were changed

{\tt s61p} were corrected.\cr
***&The table with identifier {\tt 2.cenc1} was removed because it was
inconsistent.\cr
% no power maps possible ...
C&Two instances of the table of $(A_6 \times A_6):2^2$ were unified.\cr
C&The tables with identifiers {\tt J2.2M4}, {\tt 2\^{}(2+4):(3x3):2\^{}2},
and {\tt 2\^{}(2+4):(S3xS3)} were unified;
the identifiers {\tt J2.2M5} and {\tt 2\^{}(2+4):(S3xS3)} can be used to
access the table.\cr
NEW&The ordinary tables of all maximal subgroups

of $Fi_{22}$ was corrected from {\tt (2x2\^{}(1+8):U4(2)):2} to
{\tt (2x2\^{}(1+8)):U4(2):2};
similarly, {\tt (2x2\^{}(1+8):U4(2):2):2} was corrected to
{\tt (2x2\^{}(1+8)):(U4(2):2x2)}.\cr
NEW&Fi_{22}&:&The tables of the maximal subgroups $2^{10}:M_{22}:2$ of
$Fi_{22}.2$ and $2^{11}.M_{22}$ of $2.Fi_{22}$ are now available
via the names {\tt Fi22.2M4} and {\tt 2.Fi22M5}, respectively.\cr
C&U_3(5)&:&The table with identifier {\tt U3(5).S3} was removed;
it is replaced by the table with identifier {\tt U3(5).3.2}
whose cosets of the outer automorphism group are ordered as in the
Atlas of Finite Groups.
The identifier {\tt U3(5).S3} is now admissible for the table with
identifier {\tt U3(5).3.2}.\cr
***&U_4(3)&:&The table with identifier {\tt u4q3c} was removed;
characters and power maps of this table were erroneous.
Apparently the table was thought to be that of $3_2.U_4(3).2_3^{\prime}$,
which can be accessed with the name {\tt 3\_2.U4(3).2\_3'}.\cr
NEW&U_4(3)&:&The tables of $3_2.U_4(3).(2^2)_{133}$ and $U_4(3).(2^2)_{133}$

admissible names of cyclic groups.

for $L_2(q)$, for various values of $q$,
and for {\tt 7:3}, {\tt 23:11}, {\tt 11:10},

this includes direct products and tables of small groups that can be computed
easily with standard methods.
The other way round, each ordinary table in the library for which the table
of marks is contained in the {\GAP} Library of Tables of Marks stores a
class fusion into the table of marks.\cr

groups are available, including the normalizers of cyclic Sylow subgroups.\cr

from the ordinary one; now this function has been corrected.

$2.Ru$,
$3.F_{3+}$,
$3.J_3$,
$3.McL$,
$3.ON$,
$6.Suz$, and
$12.M_{22}$.
At the time when the {\CAS} library got included in
{\GAP}'s character table library,
this information was apparently not saved.
However, at least the book ``Brauer Trees of Sporadic Groups'' refers
to the {\CAS} numbering of certain characters,
thus it is useful to make the values available.
Thanks to Gerhard Hiss for the {\CAS} format tables
which had been used in the computations for the abovementioned book.\cr}
