  <Abstract>
    &Sophus; is a GAP4 package to compute with nilpotent
Lie algebras over finite prime fields. In particular, the package can be
used to compute certain central extensions and the automorphism group
of such Lie algebras. &Sophus; also enables its user to test
isomorphism between two nilpotent Lie algebras. The author of the
package used it to construct all Lie algebras of dimension at most 9
over <Math>\mathbb F_2</Math>.

  <Acknowledgements>
    Most of the work on this package was carried out while I held a
research position at the Technische Universität Braunschweig. I
would like to express my gratitude to the staff and the students of
the Institut für Geometrie for their interest in this work. Special
thanks go to Bettina Eick for her rôle in completing this project.
