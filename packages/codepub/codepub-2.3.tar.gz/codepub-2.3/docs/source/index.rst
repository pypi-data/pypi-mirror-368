CodePUB
------------

CodePUB (Code: precise, unique, balanced) is a Python tool developed for construction of balanced constant-weight Gray
codes for detecting consecutive positives (DCP-CWGCs) for the
efficient construction of combinatorial pooling schemes. To learn more about DCP-CWGCs, read the **Introduction** section.

To understand the algorithm of constructions, read our preprint: **"Unbiased and Error-Detecting Combinatorial Pooling Experiments with Balanced Constant-Weight Gray Codes for Consecutive Positives Detection"**.

For installation guidance, visit **Installation** page.

To start using the package, read **Construction** section. To learn more about functions under the hood, visit **Function reference**.
