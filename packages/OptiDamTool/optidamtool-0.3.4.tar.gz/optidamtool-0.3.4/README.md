## About

`OptiDamTool` is a Python package designed for analytics and decision-making in dam management. Conceptualized and released on May 29, 2025, the package offers tools for modeling and analyzing hydrological flow across a network of connected dams.


Leveraging functionalities from the open-source [GeoAnalyze](https://github.com/debpal/GeoAnalyze) package, `OptiDamTool` provides classes that that assist users in preparing inputs for simulating water erosion and sediment transport, and supports decision-making in dam network deployment aimed at environmental sustainability.

## Classes

### `OptiDamTool.WatemSedem`

Provides tools to prepare inputs for the [WaTEM/SEDEM](https://github.com/watem-sedem) model, which simulates soil erosion, sediment transport capacity, and sediment delivery to stream networks at the watershed scale. While this class includes built-in methods for generating most required inputs, it is still recommended to consult the `GeoAnalyze` documentation for any geospatial operations not covered by its methods.

* Converts Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data into the stream files required for the WaTEM/SEDEM model with the `river routing = 1` extension enabled.
* Extends input rasters beyond the model region and fills NoData cells with valid values, as WaTEM/SEDEM does not support NoData.
* Performs reprojection, clipping, resolution rescaling, and reclassification of rasters.
* Processes open-source [Esri land cover data](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landcover/).
* Generates a land management factor raster from land cover inputs.
* Computes the product of soil erodibility and rainfall erosivity factors.
* Converts raster files to the Idrisi raster format, with the `.rst` file extension.
* Generates effective upstream drainage area polygons for selected dam locations within a stream network.


### `OptiDamTool.Network` 
Offers methods for establishing hydrological and sedimentation flow connectivity between dams using the stream network.

* Identifies connectivity between adjacent upstream and downstream dams.
* Computes the controlled upstream drainage areas for selected dam locations within a stream network.
* Estimates sediment inflow to dams based on controlled upstream drainage areas.
* Simulates storage dynamics of individual dams in a system due to sedimentation, using a mass balance approach.
* Generates updated dam location points and their corresponding controlled drainage polygons when dams become inactive
  during system-wide storage dynamics simulation.


### `OptiDamTool.Analysis` 
Provides methods for analyzing simulation outputs and generating insights.

* Integrates sediment delivery to stream segments.
* Generates stream shapefiles with comprehensive information of each segment's drainage area and sediment input.
* Summarizes total sediment dynamics for the model region.
* Assigns a Coordinate Reference System and the default `GTiff` driver to output Idrisi raster files from a WaTEM/SEDEM simulation.
