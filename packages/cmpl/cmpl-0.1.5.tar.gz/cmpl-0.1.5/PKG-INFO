# CMPL - CMRR MRI Processing Libraries

## Introduction
Welcome to CMPL (CMRR MRI Processing Libraries), a specialized Python toolkit tailored for MRI data conversion, visualization, and filtering. CMPL is designed to assist researchers and practitioners in the field of MRI by offering efficient and user-friendly tools for specific MRI image processing tasks.

## Features
- **K-space Reconstruction:**
  - **Under sampling treatments**:
    - 1D Grappa
    - 2D Grappa
  - 
- **Data Conversion:** Robust tools to convert MRI data into various formats for compatibility and ease of use. (partly implemented)
- **3D Visualization:** Advanced capabilities for generating and manipulating 3D visualizations from MRI datasets.(tentative)
- **Filtering Functions:** A suite of filters for enhancing image quality, including noise reduction and edge enhancement.(tentative)

## Installation(future)
Install CMPL using pip:
```bash
pip install cmpl
```
