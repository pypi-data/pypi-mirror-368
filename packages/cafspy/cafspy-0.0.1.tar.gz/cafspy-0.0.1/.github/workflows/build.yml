# GitHub Actions Workflow: Test and Build Python Package
#
# This workflow is triggered on every push to the 'main' branch.
# It first runs tests, and if they pass, it builds the Python project
# into a source archive (.tar.gz) and a wheel (.whl), and then
# uploads these files as build artifacts.

name: Test and Build Python Package

# Controls when the workflow will run.
# Triggers the workflow on push and pull request events but only for the "main" branch.
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel.
jobs:
  # This job runs the test suite.
  test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it.
