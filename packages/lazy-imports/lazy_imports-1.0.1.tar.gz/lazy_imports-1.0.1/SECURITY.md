This project is built with security and data privacy in mind to ensure your data is safe.
We are grateful for security researchers and users reporting a vulnerability to us first.
To ensure that your request is handled in a timely manner and non-disclosure of vulnerabilities can be assured, please follow the below guideline.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities directly on GitHub.
GitHub Issues can be publicly seen and therefore would result in a direct disclosure.**

Please send questions about data privacy, security concepts, and other media requests via email to [lazy-imports.vista851@passmail.net](mailto:lazy-imports.vista851@passmail.net).
