## Our Values

Django Mercury is built on the principles of **Fair**, **Free**, and **Open** software:

- **Fair**: Everyone has equal opportunity to contribute and benefit
- **Free**: Freedom to use, study, share, and improve the software
- **Open**: Transparent development and accessible knowledge

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:
- GitHub repositories and discussions
- Community Discord/Slack channels
- Project documentation and wikis
- Community events and meetups
- Social media interactions related to the project

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:
- **Email**: conduct@djangoperformance.dev
- **GitHub**: Create a private security advisory in the repository

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

## Learning and Growth

We recognize that everyone makes mistakes. If you've acted inappropriately:
1. Listen to the feedback without becoming defensive
2. Apologize sincerely and specifically
3. Commit to doing better
4. Follow through on your commitment
5. Learn from the experience and help others avoid similar mistakes

## Special Considerations for Educational Content

As a project focused on teaching performance optimization:
- We encourage questions at all levels
- "There are no stupid questions" is our motto
- Experts should remember they were once beginners
- Explain concepts clearly without condescension
- Celebrate learning moments, even from mistakes
