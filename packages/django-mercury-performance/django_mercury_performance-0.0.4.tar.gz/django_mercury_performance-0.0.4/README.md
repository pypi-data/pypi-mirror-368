**Part of the [Human in the Loop](https://github.com/80-20-Human-In-The-Loop) ecosystem**

> Test Django app speed. Learn why it's slow. Fix it.

## 🚀 Quick Install

```bash
pip install django-mercury-performance
```

Then in your test files:
```python
from django_mercury import DjangoMercuryAPITestCase

class MyPerformanceTest(DjangoMercuryAPITestCase):
    def test_api_performance(self):
        response = self.client.get('/api/endpoint/')
        # Performance is automatically monitored and reported!
```

## 🌟 Origin Story

Mercury started at [EduLite](https://github.com/ibrahim-sisar/EduLite). EduLite helps students learn with slow internet. We found our UserSearchView made **825 database queries** to show one page!

We built Mercury to find these problems and teach you how to fix them. Mercury follows EduLite's values: **Fair**, **Free**, and **Open**. Everyone can use it and learn.

## 🎯 Current Status: v0.0.2 on PyPI! 🎉

**What Works Now:**
- ✅ **Install from PyPI** - `pip install django-mercury-performance`
- ✅ **NEW: Educational Mode (`--edu`)** - Interactive learning while testing
- ✅ Finds N+1 query problems
- ✅ Grades speed (S, A+, A, B, C, D, F) 
- ✅ Two test types: `DjangoMercuryAPITestCase` and `DjangoPerformanceAPITestCase`
- ✅ Knows what type of code runs
- ✅ Teaches when tests fail
- ✅ Fast C code for speed
- ✅ Tracks time, queries, and memory

**What We Actually Found:**
```text

```

Mercury will pause at performance issues to teach you!

#### 💼 Professional Mode - Automatic Monitoring (Default)

```python
from django_mercury import DjangoMercuryAPITestCase

class UserSearchPerformanceTest(DjangoMercuryAPITestCase):
    """Mercury monitors every test automatically."""
    
    def test_user_search(self):
        # Write your normal test
        response = self.client.get('/api/users/search/?q=test')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        # Mercury checks performance automatically
```

**What Mercury does:**
- Counts database queries

- Shows clear reports

#### 💼 Advanced: Manual Control

You control when to monitor. Good for specific performance checks.

```python
from django_mercury import DjangoPerformanceAPITestCase
from django_mercury import monitor_django_view

class AdvancedPerformanceTest(DjangoPerformanceAPITestCase):
    """Control exactly what you test."""
    
    def test_with_assertions(self):
        with monitor_django_view("search") as monitor:
            response = self.client.get('/api/users/search/')
        
        # Check specific limits
        self.assertResponseTimeLess(monitor, 100)  # Under 100ms
        self.assertQueriesLess(monitor, 10)         # Under 10 queries
        self.assertNoNPlusOne(monitor)              # No N+1 problems
```

**You control:**
- When monitoring starts
- What to check
- Your performance limits

## 🎓 How Mercury Works

Mercury follows the [Human in the Loop](https://github.com/80-20-Human-In-The-Loop/Community) philosophy:

**80% Computer Help:**
- Watches performance automatically
- Finds N+1 problems
- Grades your code speed
- Manages limits

**20% Human Control:**
- You understand WHY speed matters
- You choose how to fix problems
- You learn from the guides
- You make design choices

**Example: How Mercury Teaches**

When a test fails, Mercury helps you learn:

```text
📚 MERCURY EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE
============================================================
🎯 Test: test_user_list_view
⚠️  Default thresholds exceeded

🗃️  Query Count: 230 (limit: 10)
   → 220 extra queries (2200% exceeded)

💡 SOLUTION: N+1 Query Pattern Detected
   Your code is likely missing select_related() or prefetch_related()
   
   Try: User.objects.select_related('profile').prefetch_related('groups')

🛠️  Quick Fix for Testing:
   cls.set_performance_thresholds({'query_count_max': 250})
   
   But the REAL fix is optimizing your queries!
============================================================
```

## 🛠️ Performance Checks

### Test Methods You Can Use

```python
# Check response time
self.assertResponseTimeLess(monitor, 100)    # Must be under 100ms
self.assertPerformanceFast(monitor)          # Must be fast
self.assertPerformanceNotSlow(monitor)       # Must not be slow

# Check database queries  
self.assertQueriesLess(monitor, 10)          # Must use less than 10 queries
self.assertNoNPlusOne(monitor)               # Must not have N+1 problems

# Check memory use
self.assertMemoryLess(monitor, 50)           # Must use less than 50MB
self.assertMemoryEfficient(monitor)          # Must use memory well

# Check cache use
self.assertGoodCachePerformance(monitor, 0.8) # Must hit cache 80% of time
```

## 🔧 Setup Options

```python
class MyTest(DjangoMercuryAPITestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        super().setUpClass()
        
        # Turn Mercury features on or off
        cls.configure_mercury(
            enabled=True,               # Turn on Mercury
            auto_scoring=True,          # Grade tests automatically
            verbose_reporting=False,    # Show less detail
            educational_guidance=True   # Show help messages
        )
        
        # Set your speed limits
        cls.set_performance_thresholds({
            'response_time_ms': 100,    # Max time: 100ms
            'query_count_max': 10,      # Max queries: 10
            'memory_overhead_mb': 20,   # Max extra memory: 20MB
        })
```

## 🧪 Testing Django Mercury

We provide two test runners to help you test the framework.

### What Our Tests Do

Tests make sure Django Mercury works correctly. They check:
- Python code works as expected
- C extensions compile and run fast
- Performance monitoring catches problems
- Everything works together

### Two Test Runners

#### 1. Python Test Runner: `test_runner.py`

Tests all Python code with performance timing.

**Features:**
- Shows test speed with colors (🟢 fast, 🟡 medium, 🔴 slow, 💀 very slow)
- Coverage reports (how much code is tested)
- Finds slow tests automatically
- Groups results by module

#### 2. C Test Runner: `c_test_runner.sh`  

Tests all C extensions for speed and correctness.

**Features:**
- Builds C libraries
- Runs unit tests
- Checks memory safety
- Generates coverage reports

### How to Run Tests

#### Quick Start (Test Everything)

```bash
# Test Python code
python test_runner.py

# Test C code  
./c_test_runner.sh test
```

#### Detailed Testing

```bash
# Python tests with coverage report
python test_runner.py --coverage --verbose

# C tests with coverage analysis
./c_test_runner.sh coverage

# Test everything
python test_runner.py --all
./c_test_runner.sh all
```

### Understanding Test Output

#### Python Test Colors

Your tests show timing with colors:
