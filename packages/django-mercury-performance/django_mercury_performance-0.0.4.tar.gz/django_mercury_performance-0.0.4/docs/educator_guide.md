## Educational Philosophy

### 80-20 Human-in-the-Loop Approach

Django Mercury follows the **80-20 Human-in-the-Loop** principle:

- **80% Automated Analysis**: Mercury automatically detects performance issues, generates educational content, and provides optimization suggestions
- **20% Human Learning**: Students actively engage with quizzes, code challenges, and decision-making about optimizations

This approach ensures students learn through guided discovery rather than passive information consumption.

### Learning by Doing

Mercury's educational system emphasizes:

1. **Real Problem Detection**: Students encounter actual performance issues in their code
2. **Interactive Problem Solving**: Quizzes and challenges reinforce learning at the moment of discovery
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Performance improvements are visualized instantly
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Difficulty adapts based on student progress and skill level

### Global Accessibility

Mercury's educational content is designed for international accessibility:
- **Simple English**: Clear, direct language that translates well
- **Cultural Neutrality**: Examples and references work across different contexts
- **Low-Bandwidth Friendly**: Works without requiring high-speed internet
- **Offline Capable**: Core functionality works without internet connectivity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

#### **Mercury Not Detecting Educational Mode**
```python
# Check if educational mode is active
import os
print("Educational mode:", os.environ.get('MERCURY_EDUCATIONAL_MODE', 'Not set'))

# Ensure proper test runner configuration
if '--edu' in sys.argv:
    TEST_RUNNER = 'django_mercury.test_runner.EducationalTestRunner'
```

#### **Missing Rich Console Output**
```bash
# Install rich for enhanced educational experience
pip install rich

# Verify rich is available
python -c "from rich.console import Console; print('✅ Rich available')"
```

#### **C Extensions Not Available**
When C extensions aren't available, Mercury falls back to Python implementations:
```python
# Check C extension availability
from django_mercury.python_bindings import HAS_C_EXTENSIONS
print(f"C Extensions: {'Available' if HAS_C_EXTENSIONS else 'Using Python fallback'}")
```

**Educational Impact:** Pure Python fallback provides identical educational features but may be slightly slower for performance monitoring.

### Student Help Strategies

#### **When Students Are Overwhelmed**
**Symptoms:**
- Quiz accuracy consistently <50%
- Reluctance to engage with performance challenges
- Confusion about optimization concepts

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Reduce difficulty temporarily
MERCURY_EDU_LEVEL=beginner python manage.py test --edu

# Focus on one concept at a time
python manage.py test --edu specific_n1_examples

# Provide additional practice examples
python manage.py test --edu examples.educational_examples.BeginnerN1QueryExamples
```

**Teaching Strategies:**
- **Pair Programming**: Partner struggling students with stronger peers
- **Simplified Examples**: Start with very basic optimization scenarios
- **Concept Mapping**: Visual diagrams showing optimization technique relationships
- **Office Hours**: Individual tutoring focusing on specific confusion points

#### **When Students Are Bored (Too Easy)**
**Symptoms:**
- Quiz accuracy consistently >95%
- Completing challenges quickly
- Asking for more complex scenarios

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Increase difficulty level
MERCURY_EDU_LEVEL=advanced python manage.py test --edu

# Introduce complex scenarios
python manage.py test --edu examples.educational_examples.AdvancedPerformanceExamples

# Challenge with architecture problems
# Student designs optimization for high-scale scenarios
```

**Advanced Challenges:**
- **Architecture Design**: Design performance solutions for large-scale applications
- **Peer Teaching**: Advanced students help teach and mentor others
- **Open Source Contribution**: Optimize performance in real open source projects
- **Research Projects**: Investigate cutting-edge Django performance techniques

### Performance Issues with Mercury Itself

#### **Slow Test Execution**
If Mercury's educational features slow down tests significantly:

```python
# Configure for faster educational testing
DJANGO_MERCURY = {
    'EDUCATIONAL_MODE': True,
    'QUICK_MODE': True,           # Reduce detailed analysis for speed
    'SAMPLE_SIZE': 50,            # Smaller sample sizes for faster feedback
    'SKIP_MEMORY_PROFILING': True  # Skip memory analysis for speed
}
```

#### **Memory Usage in Large Classes**
For classes with many students or large datasets:

```python
# Memory-efficient educational configuration
DJANGO_MERCURY = {
    'EDUCATIONAL_MODE': True,
    'BATCH_SIZE': 10,             # Process students in smaller batches
    'CLEANUP_INTERVAL': 5,        # Clean up test data more frequently
    'PROGRESS_SAVE_FREQUENCY': 1  # Save progress after each test
}
```
