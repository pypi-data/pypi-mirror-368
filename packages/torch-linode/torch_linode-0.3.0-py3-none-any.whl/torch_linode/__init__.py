Torch Magnus Solvers

A PyTorch-based library for solving linear matrix ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) using Magnus-type integrators. This package provides efficient and
differentiable solvers suitable for problems in quantum mechanics, control theory,
and other areas of physics and engineering.

Available Functions:
- odeint: Solves the ODE at specified time points.
- odeint_adjoint: Solves the ODE with a memory-efficient adjoint method for backpropagation.
- adaptive_ode_solve: A lower-level solver for adaptive-step integration over a single interval.
