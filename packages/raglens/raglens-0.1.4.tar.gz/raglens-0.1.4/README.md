# Raglens: Visual Diagnostics for Embedding Models in RAG Pipelines

Raglens is a visual, CLI, and UI-based diagnostic toolkit designed to inspect and compare embedding models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It allows you to probe token-level and chunk-level representations, assess pooling strategies, analyze similarity matrices, and understand how embeddings change across model layers. Optionally, you can generate AI-powered explanations for each plot in your preferred language using LLMs.

## Installation

You can install Raglens from PyPI or from source, using either `pip` or the [uv package manager](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

### From PyPI (recommended for most users)

#### Using pip

```bash
pip install raglens
```

#### Using uv

```bash
uv pip install raglens
```
or
```bash
uv add raglens
```

### From source (for development)

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gegedenice/raglens.git
cd raglens
```

#### Using pip

```bash
pip install -e .
```

#### Using uv

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

If you need to install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can use `uv` as a drop-in replacement for `pip` in all commands throughout this README.

## Features Overview

### Token-Level Diagnostics

- **`plot_token_geometry`**: Projects token embeddings into 2D using PCA or UMAP. Reveals how tokens are distributed in embedding space, helping you understand semantic clustering and outliers.
- **`compare_pooling_methods`**: Visualizes and compares CLS, mean, and max pooling strategies for sentence embeddings. Useful for selecting the most representative pooling method for downstream tasks.
- **`layerwise_token_drift`**: Shows how selected token representations evolve across transformer layers. Helps diagnose how information propagates and transforms through the model.
- **`embedding_distribution_stats`**: Plots distributional statistics (e.g., L2 norms, explained variance) for token embeddings. Useful for detecting anomalies or understanding embedding magnitude and variance.

### Chunk-Level Diagnostics

- **`chunking_sanity`**: Inspects how tokenization splits long texts into chunks. Highlights chunk boundaries and overlap, ensuring proper chunking for retrieval.
- **`plot_chunk_geometry`**: Scatter plots chunk embeddings (optionally with a query) in 2D space, colored by pooling strategy. Reveals chunk clustering and query proximity.
- **`semantic_similarity_matrix`**: Displays a heatmap of inter-sentence or inter-chunk similarities. Useful for visualizing semantic relationships and redundancy.

### Retrieval Diagnostics

- **`compare_retrieval_pooling`**: Visualizes the impact of different pooling strategies on top-k chunk retrieval. Helps you select the best pooling method for retrieval accuracy.

### LLM-based Interpretation (Optional)

- **`--generate-explanation`**: Adds AI-generated interpretation of the plots using OpenAI or Hugging Face APIs.
- **`--language`**: Selects the language for LLM explanations (e.g., English, French, Spanish).
- Requires setting an environment variable or `--api-key` flag with your access key.

## EmbeddingModel Class

Raglens uses a flexible embedding interface:

```python
from raglens.embeddings import EmbeddingModel
model = EmbeddingModel(model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

### Optional: Custom Model Storage

```python
model = EmbeddingModel(model_name="...", model_dir="./my_models")
```

### Automatic Strategy Support Detection

```python
print("Supported pooling strategies:", model.get_supported_strategies())
```

---

## Model Compatibility

Supports any HuggingFace-compatible encoder-based transformer model. Pooling strategies adapt based on architecture (e.g., CLS only enabled if present).

---

## Function Reference

### Token-Level

- **plot_token_geometry**: Visualizes token embeddings in 2D (PCA/UMAP). Shows semantic clusters and outliers.
- **compare_pooling_methods**: Compares sentence-level embeddings from different pooling strategies.
- **layerwise_token_drift**: Tracks how specific tokens change across model layers.
- **embedding_distribution_stats**: Plots L2 norms and explained variance for embeddings.

### Chunk-Level

- **chunking_sanity**: Shows how text is split into chunks, highlighting overlaps and boundaries.
- **plot_chunk_geometry**: Plots chunk embeddings and optionally a query, showing their spatial relationships.
- **semantic_similarity_matrix**: Heatmap of similarities between chunks.

### Retrieval

- **compare_retrieval_pooling**: Compares retrieval results for different pooling strategies, visualizing top-k matches.

### LLM Explanation

All plotting functions support `generate_explanation=True` and `language="..."` for AI-powered, language-specific plot interpretation.

---

## How to Use LLM Explanations

- Set `--generate-explanation` in CLI or `generate_explanation=True` in Python.
- Set `--language` in CLI or `language="..."` in Python.
- Provide your API key via `--api-key` or environment variable.
- The explanation will be generated in your chosen language and printed after each plot.
