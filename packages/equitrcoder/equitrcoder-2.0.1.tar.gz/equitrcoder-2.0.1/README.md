# EQUITR Coder

Modular AI coding assistant supporting single and multi-agent workflows and an ML-focused researcher mode. Includes an advanced TUI.

## Modes
- Single agent
- Multi-agent parallel (profiles and team-based)
- Researcher (ML only): interactive planning + multi-agent execution + experiments; final report is generated automatically by the supervisor model in Markdown

## TUI (Advanced Only)
- Launch: `equitrcoder tui --mode single|multi|research`
- Research mode input fields:
  - Datasets: comma-separated paths
  - Experiments: `name:command; name:command; ...`

## CLI
- Single: `equitrcoder single "Task" --model moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview`
- Multi: `equitrcoder multi "Task" --supervisor-model ... --worker-model ... --workers 3`
- Research (ML only): `equitrcoder research "Research task" --supervisor-model ... --worker-model ... --workers 3`
  - Team defaults: `ml_researcher,data_engineer,experiment_runner`
  - Report is generated by the supervisor model (no report-writer agent)

## Programmatic
Use `ResearchTaskConfiguration` with optional `research_context` to skip interactive prompts.

## Profiles
Specialized profiles for research mode (additional tools only; defaults inherited):
- `ml_researcher.yaml`
- `data_engineer.yaml`
- `experiment_runner.yaml`

## Docs
- `equitrcoder/docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md` updated for research mode
- `equitrcoder/docs/CREATING_PROFILES.md` documents profile tool inheritance and research profiles

## Examples
- See `equitrcoder/examples/` for usage patterns
