Testing your MCP servers thoroughly is essential for ensuring they work correctly when deployed. FastMCP makes this easy through a variety of testing patterns.

## In-Memory Testing

The most efficient way to test an MCP server is to pass your FastMCP server instance directly to a Client. This enables in-memory testing without having to start a separate server process, which is particularly useful because managing an MCP server programmatically can be challenging.

Here is an example of using a `Client` to test a server with pytest:

```python
import pytest
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

@pytest.fixture
def mcp_server():
    server = FastMCP("TestServer")
    
    @server.tool
    def greet(name: str) -> str:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
        
    return server

async def test_tool_functionality(mcp_server):
    # Pass the server directly to the Client constructor
    async with Client(mcp_server) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": "World"})
        assert result.data == "Hello, World!"
```

This pattern creates a direct connection between the client and server, allowing you to test your server's functionality efficiently.

<Tip>
If you're using pytest for async tests, as shown above, you may need to configure appropriate markers or set `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in your pytest configuration in order to handle async test functions automatically.

## Mocking

FastMCP servers are designed to work seamlessly with standard Python testing tools and patterns. There's nothing special about testing FastMCP servers - you can use all the familiar Python mocking, patching, and testing techniques you already know.
