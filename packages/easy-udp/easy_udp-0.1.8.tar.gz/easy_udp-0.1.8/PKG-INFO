# Easy UDP

Easy UDP is a Python package that simplifies UDP communication. It provides convenient classes for UDP Sender and Receiver implementations.

## Installation

```bash
pip install easy-udp
```

## Usage

### UDP Sender
```python
from easy_udp import UDPSender
import numpy as np

# Create UDP sender instance
udp_sender = UDPSender(host="localhost", port=12345)

# Sending data
print("Sending: 123")
udp_sender.send(123)

print("Sending: Hello, World!")
udp_sender.send("Hello, World!")

img = np.random.randint(0, 255, (1280, 720, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
print("Sending: img", img)
udp_sender.send(img)

# Send arbitrary Python object (picklable)
class Foo:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x

obj = {"a": 1, "b": [1, 2, 3], "foo": Foo(5)}
udp_sender.send(obj)

```

### UDP Receiver
```python
from easy_udp import UDPReceiver
import numpy as np

# Create UDP receiver instance
udp_receiver = UDPReceiver(host="localhost", port=12345)

# receive data
while True:
    received_data = udp_receiver.receive()
    if received_data is not None:
        if isinstance(received_data, np.ndarray):
            received_data = received_data.reshape((1280, 720, 3))
            print("Received: img", received_data)

        if isinstance(received_data, str):
            print("Received: str", received_data)

        if isinstance(received_data, int):
            print("Received: int", received_data)

        # Any other type вЂ” it's likely an arbitrary Python object
        else:
            print("Received: object", type(received_data), received_data)
```

You can also use context managers for automatic socket cleanup:

```python
from easy_udp import UDPSender

with UDPSender(host="localhost", port=12345) as sender:
    sender.send("hello")
```

`UDPReceiver` supports optional timeout to avoid busy-waiting:

```python
from easy_udp import UDPReceiver

receiver = UDPReceiver(host="localhost", port=12345, recv_timeout_s=1.0)
data = receiver.receive()  # returns None on timeout
```

## Changelog

### 0.1.8
- Added context manager support for `UDPSender`/`UDPReceiver` and safe socket lifecycle (`close()`, `__enter__`, `__exit__`).
- Enabled `SO_REUSEADDR` for faster restarts.
- Added `recv_timeout_s` (optional) to `UDPReceiver` to prevent busy-waiting; added small collection window in non-blocking mode.
- Adjusted fragmentation to MTU-safe payloads (~1400 bytes) to avoid IP fragmentation and reduce packet loss.
- Added support for sending arbitrary Python objects via pickle (falls back in `UDPSender.send()` and handled in `UDPReceiver`).
- Improved error messages and type hints; minor README updates and examples.

Security note: pickle is unsafe with untrusted sources. Only enable/use object transfer in trusted environments.

### 0.1.7
- Initial public API: `UDPSender` and `UDPReceiver` with support for `numpy.ndarray`, `str`, and `int`.
