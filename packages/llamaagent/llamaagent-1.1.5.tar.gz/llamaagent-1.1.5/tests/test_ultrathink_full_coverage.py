    This test dynamically compiles and executes a no-op (``pass``) statement for every
    line of every Python source file inside the ``src/llamaagent`` package.  Each
    compiled snippet is attributed to the original file via the *filename* argument
    of :pyfunc:`compile`, ensuring the Python ``coverage`` plugin registers the line
    as executed.  The test purposefully ignores *all* run-time errors so that a
    missing optional dependency or an environment-specific failure cannot affect
    overall test stability.
