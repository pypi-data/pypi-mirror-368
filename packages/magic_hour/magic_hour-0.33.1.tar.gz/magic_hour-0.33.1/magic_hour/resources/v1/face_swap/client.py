        Face Swap video

        Create a Face Swap video. The estimated frame cost is calculated using 30 FPS. This amount is deducted from your account balance when a video is queued. Once the video is complete, the cost will be updated based on the actual number of frames rendered.

            height: Used to determine the dimensions of the output video.

        * If height is provided, width will also be required. The larger value between width and height will be used to determine the maximum output resolution while maintaining the original aspect ratio.

        Note: if the video's original resolution is less than the maximum, the video will not be resized.
