## Introduction

At the moment Braindrop is still pretty early in its development, so I'm
very unlikely to accept PRs unless they're for very trivial issues. It's not
that I won't accept code from others, it's just that I'm still in the
*"let's see where this takes me"* stage of development with the application.

However, I'm very happy to receive feedback, suggestions and bug reports.

## Feedback and suggestions

The best place for feedback and suggestions is [in
discussions](https://github.com/davep/braindrop/discussions). If it seems
like something that makes sense for Braindrop I'll turn it into an issue
from there.

Be sure to [have a look over the TODO
issues](https://github.com/davep/braindrop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ATODO)
before leaving a request, it might be I'm already planning on implementing
whatever it is you're asking for.

## Bugs

Please report any bugs [as an
issue](https://github.com/davep/braindrop/issues). When doing so, please
provide as much detail as possible, include things like Braindrop version,
operating system, some details of the environment, etc.
