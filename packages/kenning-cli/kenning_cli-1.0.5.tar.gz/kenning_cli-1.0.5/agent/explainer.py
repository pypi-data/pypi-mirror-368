"""
AI Explanation Engine - Transforming Technical Risks into Human Understanding

This module contains Kenning's AI explanation system, which bridges the gap between
complex technical risk analysis and human comprehension. It transforms the structured
output from Kenning's correlation engine into clear, actionable insights that both
technical and non-technical stakeholders can understand and act upon.

The explanation engine demonstrates advanced prompt engineering techniques and implements
robust AI integration patterns that ensure reliable, structured responses from Large
Language Models. It showcases how to build production-ready AI features that enhance
rather than replace human expertise.

Key Features:
    - Sophisticated prompt engineering for consistent AI responses
    - Structured output validation using Pydantic models
    - Integration with local LLMs via Ollama for data privacy
    - Contextual risk analysis that explains "why" not just "what"
    - Professional explanation formatting for stakeholder communication

Architecture:
    - PromptEngine: Constructs sophisticated prompts for AI analysis
    - AIExplainer: Orchestrates the complete explanation pipeline
    - Structured output: Pydantic models ensure reliable AI responses
    - Error handling: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

The module embodies Kenning's core philosophy: making complex cloud security and cost
correlation analysis accessible to human decision-makers through AI-augmented insights.

class PromptEngine:
    """
    Constructs sophisticated, schema-driven prompts for AI risk analysis.

    This class implements advanced prompt engineering techniques to ensure consistent,
    high-quality AI responses from Large Language Models. It demonstrates how to build
    reliable AI integrations through careful prompt design, structured output requirements,
    and domain expertise encoding.

    The PromptEngine follows the "persona-based prompting" strategy, establishing a
    clear expert identity for the AI to emulate. This approach significantly improves
    response quality by providing context for the type of analysis required.

    Key Design Patterns:
    - Schema-driven prompts: Uses Pydantic model schemas to ensure structured output
    - Role-based messaging: Implements the system/user message pattern for clarity
    - Domain expertise encoding: Embeds specific cloud security knowledge in prompts
    - Context preservation: Maintains risk metadata through the analysis pipeline

    Architecture:
    - create_messages(): Main entry point for prompt generation
    - _build_user_prompt(): Constructs detailed analysis context
    - Schema integration: Automatically includes Pydantic model requirements
    """

    def create_messages(self, risk: RiskItem) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
        """
        Create a structured message list for Large Language Model analysis.

        This method implements the "conversation design pattern" used by modern LLMs,
        where system messages establish persona and requirements, while user messages
        provide specific task context and data. This separation enables consistent
        AI behavior across different risk types and scenarios.

        The function demonstrates advanced prompt engineering by:
        - Establishing expert persona to improve analysis quality
        - Encoding domain-specific knowledge about compound risks
        - Requiring structured JSON output for reliable parsing
        - Including comprehensive context for informed analysis

        Args:
            risk (RiskItem): The compound risk requiring AI explanation. Must include
                           correlation metadata for proper contextual analysis.

        Returns:
            List[Dict[str, str]]: Structured message list with system and user roles

                                 risk context.

        Example:
            >>> engine = PromptEngine()
            >>> risk = RiskItem(...)  # Compound risk from correlator
            >>> messages = engine.create_messages(risk)
