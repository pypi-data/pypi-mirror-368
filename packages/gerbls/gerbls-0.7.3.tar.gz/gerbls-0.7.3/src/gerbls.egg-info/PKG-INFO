# GERBLS

**GERBLS** (**G**reatly **E**xpedited **R**obust **B**ox **L**east **S**quares) is a lightweight fast-folding implementation of the BLS (Box Least Squares) algorithm. It is designed to facilitate transiting planet searches in photometric data via an easy setup and fast runtimes.

`GERBLS` can outperform popular brute-force BLS implementations such as `astropy.timeseries.BoxLeastSquares` by **over 10-20x** in runtime speed.

## Installation

Refer to the [documentation](https://gerbls.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) for installation instructions.

If you encounter any issues while installing or using GERBLS, or would like to request a feature to be added to the code, please do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:kxm821@psu.edu).

## Documentation

A "Read The Docs" documentation page can be accessed [here](https://gerbls.readthedocs.io/).

## Basic usage

> [!NOTE]
> The basic usage function below does not provide many of the more advanced customization options that are available in GERBLS - see the full documentation for more info.

A detrended light curve is required to run the BLS. You may use any of your favorite detrending algorithms; `scipy.signal.savgol_filter` is a relatively good option for long-term variability. A convenience function has been implemented for easy generation of the BLS spectrum, with the following parameters:
```
def run_bls(time: npt.ArrayLike,
            mag: npt.ArrayLike,
            err: npt.ArrayLike,
            min_period: float,
            max_period: float,
            durations: list = [],
            t_samp: float = 0.):
    """
    A basic convenience function to generate a BLS spectrum.
    The data must be evenly sampled in time to run the BLS,
    use t_samp to specify the cadence for any resampling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time : npt.ArrayLike
        Array of observation timestamps.
    mag : npt.ArrayLike
        Array of observed fluxes.
    err : npt.ArrayLike
        Array of flux uncertainties for each observation.
    min_period : float
        Minimum BLS period to search.
    max_period : float
        Maximum BLS period to search.
    durations : list
        List of transit durations to test at each period.
    t_samp : float, optional
        Time sampling to bin the data before running the BLS.
        If 0 (default), the median time difference between observations is used.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Dictionary with BLS results:
        `P` is the list of tested periods
        `dchi2` is the BLS statistic (Delta chi squared) at each period
        `t0` is the best-fit transit mid-point at each period
        `dur` is the best-fit duration at each period
        `mag0` is the best-fit flux baseline at each period
        `dmag` is the best-fit transit depth at each period
    """
```

For example, running the following Python script generates a BLS spectrum for orbital periods between 0.4 and 10 days, where the light curve has been stored in arrays `time`, `mag`, and `err`. At each period, it fits for transit durations of 1 and 2 hours.
```
from gerbls import run_bls
results = run_bls(time, mag, err, 0.4, 10., durations=[1./24, 2./24])
```

`results` is a Python dictionary with the keys defined above in the function description. The searched periods are approximately evenly spaced in frequency, and the spacing is set by the time sampling of the data. The BLS statistic `results['dchi2']` ($\Delta\chi^2$) is the difference between the total $\chi^2$ parameters of a box-shaped model and a constant flux model fit to the data. In the case of pure Gaussian white noise, the signal-to-noise ratio of the fitted transit can be estimated as $\sqrt{\Delta\chi^2}$.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The fast-folding algorithm does not allow the period grid to be set directly - increase the value of `t_samp` to indirectly search fewer periods, which will also speed up the BLS.**

The fast-folding BLS requires data to be evenly spaced in time. `gerbls.run_bls` provides an optional parameter `t_samp` that can be used to resample (bin) the data to the required cadence before running the BLS. Increasing this value will make the BLS run faster; however, one should make sure that any real transits in the data are at least a few times larger than the value for `t_samp` so they do not get removed by the binning. If no value is provided for `t_samp`, the median time sampling of the input data is used: this works well if the input `time` array is already close to evenly sampled.

## Features in development

There are multiple additional features that are currently in various stages of development but need to be tested more thoroughly before they can be released publicly. These include:
- Various light curve detrending methods (Savitsky-Golay filter, Gaussian Process, etc.)
- Post-BLS limb-darkened transit model fitting
- Period-dependent bootstrap FAP calculation, which allows the significance of any potential transit to be evaluated (or alternative, an S/R threshold to be set) as a function of orbital period
- Additional tools to implement fake transit injection and recovery searches

## Acknowledgements

`GERBLS` includes some C code from the publicly available pulsar-searching [riptide](https://github.com/v-morello/riptide) package to implement the fast-folding algorithm.
