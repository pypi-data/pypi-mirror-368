# Google-Meet-Bot
This project is a Python bot that automates the process of logging into Gmail, joining a Google Meet, recording the audio of the meeting, and then generating a summary, key points, action items, and sentiment analysis of the meeting. 


## Recording video/audio/transcripts from video conferencing calls
If youâ€™re looking to use this repo to retrieve video/audio streams or transcripts from meeting platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, consider checking out [Recall.ai](https://www.recall.ai), an API for meeting recording.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Chrome browser
- OpenAI API Key
- A Gmail account
- A Google Meet link
- ffmpeg/ffprobe installed and available on PATH (for audio trimming if needed)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhruvldrp9/Google-Meet-Bot.git
   cd Google-Meet-Bot
   ```

2. Create Python environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

3. Activate environment:
   - For Unix/Linux/macOS:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. Install package (local):
   ```bash
   pip install -U build
   pip install .
   ```

5. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
     ```
     # Google Meet Credentials
     EMAIL_ID=your_email@gmail.com
     EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_password

     # Meeting Configuration
     MEET_LINK=https://meet.google.com/xxx-xxxx-xxx
     RECORDING_DURATION=60

     # Audio Configuration
     SAMPLE_RATE=44100
     MAX_AUDIO_SIZE_BYTES=20971520

     # OpenAI Configuration
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     GPT_MODEL=gpt-4
     WHISPER_MODEL=whisper-1
     ```

6. CLI usage:
   ```bash
   # After installation, a console script is available
   google-meet-bot --meet-link "https://meet.google.com/xxx-xxxx-xxx" --duration 60

   # Or run as a module
   python -m google_meet_bot --meet-link "https://meet.google.com/xxx-xxxx-xxx" --duration 60
   ```

7. Programmatic usage:
   ```python
   from google_meet_bot import JoinGoogleMeet, SpeechToText

   bot = JoinGoogleMeet()
   bot.Glogin()
   bot.turnOffMicCam("https://meet.google.com/xxx-xxxx-xxx")
   # ...
   ```
