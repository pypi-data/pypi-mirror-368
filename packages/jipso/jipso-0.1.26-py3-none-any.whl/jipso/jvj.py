  """Compares performance of two AI systems or evaluators.
  
  The Judgment vs Judgment function evaluates relative capabilities between
  different AI systems, human experts, or evaluation methodologies. Implements
  controlled variable methodology by maintaining identical input, prompt, and
  standards while varying only the judgment component.
  
  Enables systematic AI platform comparison, expert evaluator assessment, and
  multi-agent ensemble optimization. Supports external arbitration for
  objectivity and provides quantitative scoring for evidence-based AI
  selection and deployment decisions.
