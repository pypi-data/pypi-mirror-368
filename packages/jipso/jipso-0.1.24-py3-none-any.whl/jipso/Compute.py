  """Orchestrates complete JIPSO evaluations and workflows.
  
  The Compute class represents a complete J(I,P,S)=O evaluation unit as a
  five-dimensional vector enabling systematic AI orchestration. Provides
  forward and reverse computational capabilities for comprehensive workflow
  management and optimization.
  
  Supports batch processing, pipeline chaining, and meta-computational
  recursion for complex multi-agent coordination. Enables serialization
  for distributed computing and workflow persistence across sessions
  and platforms.
