def svs():
  """Compares effectiveness of evaluation criteria and standards.
  
  The Standard vs Standard function enables meta-evaluation of assessment
  criteria through hierarchical Super Standard frameworks. Evaluates which
  evaluation approaches better serve specific contexts, stakeholder needs,
  or outcome optimization objectives.
  
  Implements context-dependent standard effectiveness assessment without
  requiring universal "God Standard" consensus. Supports evaluation criteria
  optimization, meta-evaluation frameworks, and context-aware assessment
  strategies for systematic evaluation excellence.
