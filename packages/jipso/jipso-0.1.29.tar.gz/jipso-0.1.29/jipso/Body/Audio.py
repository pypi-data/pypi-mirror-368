  analysis for Mind layer consumption.
  
  Supports speech-to-text transcription, audio quality assessment, sentiment
  analysis from vocal characteristics, and temporal audio pattern recognition.
  Enables voice-based AI interactions, audio content evaluation, and
  multimedia orchestration workflows while abstracting technical audio
  processing complexity from reasoning operations.
