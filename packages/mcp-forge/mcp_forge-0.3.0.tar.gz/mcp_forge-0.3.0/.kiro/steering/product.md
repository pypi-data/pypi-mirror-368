## Key Features
- Generates complete Python project structure for MCP servers
- Includes separate server entry points for SSE and stdio transports
- Provides example tools and resources with Pydantic schemas
- Uses `uv` for dependency management and task running
- Early-stage project with evolving API and features

## Target Users
Developers building MCP servers who want to focus on capabilities rather than boilerplate setup.

## Project Status
This is an early version project - APIs, generated structure, and features may change as the MCP ecosystem evolves.
