# neuromotifs
Python tools to load neuronal microcircuit geometry, generate geometry-aware null models, and quantify over/under-expression of 3-node motifs.

> Paper: *Neuron Morphological Asymmetry Explains Fundamental Network Stereotypy Across Neocortex* (Gal et al.)

## Install
```bash
pip install neuromotifs
# or, for dev
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Highlights
- Motif counting for directed triplets (#1-#13)
- Geometry-driven random graph generators (1st-5th order) mirroring the paperâ€™s models
- Reproducibility notebooks for Figures 1-4
- Simple CLI: `neuromotifs motifs`, `neuromotifs generate`, `neuromotifs fit`

## Quickstart
```python
import pandas as pd
from neuromotifs import MotifCounter, GeometricGenerator

edges = pd.read_csv('data/sample/l5_ttcps_edges.csv')      # u,v directed
pos   = pd.read_csv('data/sample/l5_ttcps_positions.csv')  # id,x,y,z

counter = MotifCounter.from_edges(edges)
counts = counter.count_triplets()
print(counts)

G = GeometricGenerator.from_positions(pos)
G2 = G.generate(order=3, p_mean=0.025)
```
