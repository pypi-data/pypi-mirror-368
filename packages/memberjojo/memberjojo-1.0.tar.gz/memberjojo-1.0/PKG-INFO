# memberjojo

`memberjojo` is a Python library for managing [Membermojo](http://membermojo.co.uk/)
data from CSV imports.\
It provides member database interactions, and transaction querying.\
This is done in a local SQLite database, and does not alter anything on Membermojo.\
It provides tools to load, and query membership and transaction data efficiently
without having to use SQLite directly.\
When importing CSV files existing entries are skipped, so you can just import the
latest download and the local database is updated with new entries.\
All the transaction data is imported into the database,
but currently only a limited amount of member data is imported.

## Installation

Install via `pip`:

```bash
pip install memberjojo
```

Or clone the repo and install locally with `flit`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a16bitsysop/memberjojo.git
cd memberjojo
flit install --symlink
```

## Usage

Example loading members and using Member objects:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from membermojo import Member

# database is created if it does not exist
member_database_path = Path(Path(__file__).parent, "database", "my-members.db")
member_csv_path = Path("download", "members.csv")

members = Member(member_database_path)
members.import_csv(member_csv_path)

for member in members:
    print(member.first_name, member.last_name, member.member_num)

# Get full name for a given member number
found_name = members.get_name(1)
if found_name:
    print(f"Member with id of 1 is {found_name}")
else:
    print("Member 1 does not exist")
```
