## Project intent

Build and evolve a Python CLI named `restream.io` to interact with the Restream.io REST API and WebSocket APIs. Current implemented surface: OAuth2 login, profile retrieval, channel management, event management, stream key management, real-time streaming monitoring, real-time chat monitoring, and version reporting. The tool must be easily extensible with new endpoints, safe for local development, and automatable via AI agents.

## Language & ecosystem

- Primary language: **Python 3.11+**.
- Use `uv` as the project/virtual environment & dependency manager. Bootstrap with `uv init`, add deps with `uv add`, sync with `uv sync`, and run via `uv run restream.io <subcommand>`.
- Source layout: package code lives under `src/restream_io` to prevent accidental local imports. `pyproject.toml` is configured to discover packages under `src`.

## Versioning

- **Dynamic versioning** via `setuptools_scm`. No hardcoded `__version__` in source. Versions are derived from git tags (e.g., `v0.1.0` â†’ version `0.1.0`). Additional commits result in dev/local suffixes.
- At runtime, use `importlib.metadata.version("restream.io")` to get the installed version. If the package is not installed (development environment), fallback to calling `setuptools_scm.get_version(...)` with appropriate `root`/`relative_to` so the version still reflects git state. Provide a safe fallback of `0.0.0+unknown` on failure.

## Dependencies

- Must use `requests` for all HTTP interactions.
- Instantiate and reuse a single `requests.Session` per invocation to benefit from connection pooling and consistent headers.
- Use `click` for CLI framework to provide better user experience and maintainability over `argparse`.
- Use `attrs` for data classes and schema definitions to ensure type safety and clean serialization.
- Use `websockets` for real-time monitoring features (WebSocket connections to streaming and chat APIs).
- Use `responses` in test suites to mock HTTP endpoints; **no real network calls** in unit tests.
- Use `pytest-asyncio` for testing async WebSocket functionality.

## Authentication

- OAuth2 Authorization Code flow is required.
- Implement local redirect URI listener on `localhost` to capture authorization code.
- Use `state` parameter to mitigate CSRF attacks.
- Optional: support PKCE (code verifier/challenge) to future-proof and avoid requiring a client secret for local flows.
- Tokens (access + refresh) must be stored securely in user config (e.g., `~/.config/restream.io/`), with file permissions restricted.
- Before each API request, validate token expiry and use refresh token when necessary to obtain a new access token.
- **WebSocket Authentication**: Real-time monitoring uses query parameter authentication (`?accessToken=token`) as specified in the official Restream.io WebSocket API documentation.

## Real-time Monitoring (WebSocket APIs)

- **Streaming Monitor** (`monitor streaming`): Connects to `wss://streaming.api.restream.io/ws` to receive real-time streaming metrics, connection status, and platform updates.
- **Chat Monitor** (`monitor chat`): Connects to `wss://chat.api.restream.io/ws` to receive chat connection info, heartbeat events, and platform-specific details.
- **Event Format**: Both APIs use `action`-based message format (not `type`) with structured payloads. Always validate actual API responses before creating schemas.
- **Duration Support**: Optional `--duration` parameter to limit monitoring time, otherwise runs indefinitely until Ctrl+C.
- **Error Handling**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff, graceful shutdown on signals, and proper connection cleanup.

## CLI conventions

- Use `click` for command-line interface to provide rich features, better error handling, and improved user experience.
- Command hierarchy:
  - `restream.io platforms` - public API endpoint does not require authentication.
  - `restream.io servers` - public API endpoint does not require authentication.
  - `restream.io login`  
  - `restream.io profile`  
  - `restream.io channel list`  
  - `restream.io channel get <id>`
  - `restream.io channel set <id>`
  - `restream.io channel meta get`
  - `restream.io channel meta set`
  - `restream.io event list`  
  - `restream.io event get <id>`
  - `restream.io event history`
  - `restream.io event in-progress`
  - `restream.io event upcoming`
  - `restream.io event stream-key <id>`
  - `restream.io stream-key get`
  - `restream.io monitor streaming [--duration <seconds>]`
  - `restream.io monitor chat [--duration <seconds>]`
  - `restream.io version`  
- Support `--json` for machine-readable output.
- Support verbosity flags (`-v`/`--verbose`) for debugging details.
- Exit codes should be meaningful (0 success, non-zero for errors).

## Error handling

- Wrap API errors into user-friendly messages.
- Retry transient failures (network / 5xx) with exponential backoff.
- Clear differentiation between authentication issues, not-found, and rate limits.

## Testing

- All new functionality must be accompanied by tests.
- Use `pytest`.
- Mock all external HTTP calls using `responses`.
- Provide fixtures for repeated patterns (tokens, sample API payloads).
- Cover positive, negative, and edge cases.
- Ensure version command can be tested in both installed and source environments.

## API Schema Development

- **Never trust documented response types** - the official API documentation may not accurately reflect actual response structures.
- **Always validate actual API responses** before creating schemas for GET endpoints:
  1. First implement a minimal API call to fetch real response data
  2. Examine the actual JSON structure returned by the API
  3. Create `@attrs.define` schemas based on the real response format
  4. Handle missing or additional fields gracefully
- Only implement features available to all plan types; skip Business/Enterprise-only features unless explicitly required.

## Style & quality

- Follow PEP 8; functions should be small and focused.
- No global mutable state except where explicitly documented (e.g., shared session per invocation).
- Docstrings required for public functions explaining intent, not just signatures.
- Avoid leaking secrets in logs; mask tokens if logged.

## Extensibility

- New REST API endpoints are added in `restream_io/api.py` with corresponding CLI subcommands.
- New WebSocket functionality is added in `restream_io/websocket.py` with corresponding monitoring commands.
- Schema definitions for API responses go in `restream_io/schemas/` using `@attrs.define` classes.
- Tests must be added in parallel.
- Configuration schema evolution should be backward compatible; migrations must be explicit.

## Security

- Do not commit client secrets or access/refresh tokens into version control.
- Prefer environment variables for volatile secrets in CI contexts.

## Commit conventions

- Use imperative commit messages: e.g., "Add channel get command" not "Added" or "Adding".
- Update changelog or release notes when bumping versions.

## Release

- Tag releases in git with a `v` prefix (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
- Ensure CI fetches tags so `setuptools_scm` can compute version.

## Developer workflow

1. Add new command: extend `restream_io/api.py` + CLI + tests.
2. Run linting: `uv run isort . && uv run black . && uv run ruff check . && uv run pymarkdown scan .`
3. Commit, tag, push.

## Local development fallbacks

- If `importlib.metadata.version` fails because the package isn't installed, use `setuptools_scm.get_version` with `relative_to=__file__` to compute version from git state.
