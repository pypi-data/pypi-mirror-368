"""
Framework for component communication.

FastCC is a lightweight, efficient and developer-friendly framework for
component communication. By leveraging MQTT [1]_ for messaging and
Protocol Buffers [2]_ for data serialization, this framework ensures
fast, reliable, and bandwidth-efficient communication. Its simplicity
in setup and development makes it ideal for both small-scale and
enterprise-level applications.
