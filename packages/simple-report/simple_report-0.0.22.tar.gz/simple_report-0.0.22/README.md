### What makes Simple-Report special?

-   **Static generation:** Sharing a report shouldn't require deploying an app. Render a standalone HTML bundle which you can share or host on the web.
-   **API-first and programmatic:** Programmatically generate reports from inside of Spark, Airflow, or Jupyter. Schedule updates to build real-time dashboards.
-   **Dynamic front-end components**: Say goodbye to writing HTML. Build reports from a set of interactive components, like DataTables, tabs, and selects.
