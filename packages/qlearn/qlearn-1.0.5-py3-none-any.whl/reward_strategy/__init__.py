"""
This module provides reward strategy interfaces and implementations for reinforcement learning.

Exports:
    RewardDistance: A concrete implementation of a reward strategy based on distance metrics.
    RewardStrategy: An abstract base class defining the interface for reward strategies.
    StateFn: A type alias or callable representing a function that processes or evaluates states.

Usage:
    Import the desired reward strategy or interface to define or use custom reward mechanisms
    within reinforcement learning agents.
