    guidance="""Check Updates and Changes
   - Do not assume failure immediately if an update is not found in the main branch. Instead, verify if the update exists on the working branch and is just awaiting merge.

   - Steps:
      1. Check the Main Branch  
         - Look for the expected update in the main branch.  
         - If the update is found → Update is complete.  

      2. If Not Found, Check the Working Branch
         - Identify the branch where the update was originally written.  
         - Verify if the update exists in this branch.  

      3. Decide the Next Action Based on the Check:  
         - If the update is found in the working branch → The update is awaiting merge. No further action needed.  
         - If the update is not found in the working branch → The update failed, ask if it should be reattempted.  

      4. Important:
         - Never assume an update has failed if it is not in main. Verify the working branch before determining status.
         - If the update isn't found in any branch, it has failed.""",
