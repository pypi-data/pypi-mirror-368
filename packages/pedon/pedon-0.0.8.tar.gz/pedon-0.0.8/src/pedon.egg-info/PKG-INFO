Python package for (unsaturated) soil properties including pedotransfer functions. This package takes an object-oriented approach to soils, soil samples and soil models. Soil models that are available in this package are:
  - [Mualem-Van Genuchten](https://www.soilphysics.okstate.edu/teaching/soil-6583/references-folder/van%20Genuchten%201980.pdf)
  - [Brooks-Corey](https://www.wipp.energy.gov/library/cra/2009_cra/references/Others/Brooks_Corey_1964_Hydraulic_Properties_ERMS241117.pdf)
  - [Fredlund & Xing](https://projects.mans.edu.eg/heepf/ilppp/cources/12/pdf%20course/1/pressure/osmotic%20soilsalinity22.pdf)
  - Gardner
  - Panday ([Modflow-USG](https://www.gsienv.com/product/modflow-usg/))

This package can fit soil water retention curves and  using least squares (same as [RETC](https://www.pc-progress.com/Documents/programs/retc.pdf)) to measurements.

Measurements for different soil properties and parameters are available from these datasets:
  - [HYDRUS](https://www2.pc-progress.com/downloads/Pgm_Hydrus3D5/HYDRUS_user_Manual_V5.pdf)
  - [VS2D](https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/1983/4099/report.pdf)
  - Staring Series ([2001](https://edepot.wur.nl/43272) & [2018](https://edepot.wur.nl/512761))

Additionaly, there are pedotransfer functions implemented such as:
  - Van Genuchten: [Wösten](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706198001323/pdfft?md5=6844f89c07deb81001c2a6eea6fc9e32&pid=1-s2.0-S0016706198001323-main.pdf)
  - Van Genuchten: [Staring Series](https://edepot.wur.nl/43272)
  - Van Genuchten: [Rosetta v1, 2 & 3 (Schaap et al. 2001)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-1694(01)00466-8)
  - Brooks-Corey: [Cosby](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/25/2445/2021/hess-25-2445-2021.pdf)
