def find_radius_brute_force(tiling, radius=None, eps=1e-5) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Get adjacent polygons for the entire tiling through radius search
    This algorithm works in a brute-force manner, the distances between 
    every pair of cells are compared against the search radius.

    Time complexity: O(n^2) where n=len(tiling)
    Slow, use only for small tilings or for debugging purposes

    Arguments:
    ----------
    tiling : sub-class of Tiling
        The hyperbolic tiling object (represented by one of the "kernels")
    radius : float
        The search radius
    eps : float
        Add small value to search radius to avoid rounding issues

    Returns:
    --------
        List[List[int]] containing neighbour indices of every cell.
