# iSHAP: Succinct Interaction-Aware Explanations (KDD 2025)

iShap ([associated paper](https://eda.rg.cispa.io/prj/ishap/), [github](https://github.com/Schascha1/iSHAP)) is an interaction-aware Shapley value based explanation that partitions the feature set to
inform about the most important feature interactions whilst providing the most accurate additive representation.
While SHAP [2] explanations are easy to interpret, they often overlook interactions between features, leading to incomplete or misleading insights. On the other hand, interaction-aware methods like nShap [3] provide exhaustive explanations but are often too large and complex to interpret effectively.

iShap bridges this gap by partitioning features into significantly interacting groups, creating succinct, interpretable, and additive explanations. To identify the optimal partitioning from many possibilities, iShap introduces a criterion balancing explanation complexity with representativeness. A statistical pruning method improves runtime and helps avoid spurious interactions.

*Comparison of Shap (left), our proposal iShap (middle) and ùëõShap (right) on the Bike Sharing dataset [4]. Shap
does not reveal interactions, ùëõShap returns non-zero scores for 751 out of 1024 feature sets (ùëõ = ùëë). iShap provides a concise
explanation of 2 interactions for the high predicted demand: its is a dry and relatively warm winter day (Season:4, Hum:0.49
and Temp:0.39) and a Saturday with little wind (Weekday:6 and Windspeed:0.15).*

Experiments demonstrate that iShap more accurately reflects underlying model behavior than SHAP and nShap, and user studies indicate it is more interpretable and trustworthy.

## Features

- **Enhanced Interpretability**: Provides more interpretable SHAP values for complex models.
- **Synthetic and Real-World Data Support**: Includes experiments for both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use, facilitating quick integration into existing workflows.
