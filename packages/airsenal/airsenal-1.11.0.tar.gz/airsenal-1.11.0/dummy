Hello Hut23,
We are looking for one person (or two, to share the load) to take ownership of the Recruitment service area. Recruitment is a high-visibility service area that is crucial to REG as we expand. This person will be working closely with Eric on scheduling and process with HR, as well as with EDI and Onboarding. As recruitment is anticipated to start up again soon, this person will partake in Part 1 of the Recruitment training, described in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues/1707.
If you would like to know about experiences on this service area, previous service owners still with us today are May, James G, Fede and Camila.
Please feel free to get in touch with May/Nick if you might be interested or have any questions.
