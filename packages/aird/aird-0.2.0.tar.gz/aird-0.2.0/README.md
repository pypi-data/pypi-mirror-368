## Usage

You can run Aird using the `aird` command.

### Basic Usage

To start the server with a simple access token, run:

```bash
aird --port 8888 --access-token "your-secret-token"

**Example `config.json`:**
```json
{
  "host": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 8080,
  "root_dir": "/path/to/your/files",
  "access_token": "your-secret-token",
  "admin_token": "your-admin-secret-token",
  "enable_ldap": false,
  "ldap_server": null,
  "ldap_base_dn": null,
  "feature_flags": {
    "file_upload": true,
    "file_delete": false,
    "file_rename": true,
    "file_download": true
  }
}
```

To run with a configuration file:
```bash
aird --config /path/to/config.json

```bash
aird --enable-ldap --ldap-server "ldap://your.ldap.server" --ldap-base-dn "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
```

Users can then log in with their LDAP credentials.
