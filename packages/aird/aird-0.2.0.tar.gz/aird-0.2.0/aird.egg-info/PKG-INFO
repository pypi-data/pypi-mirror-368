## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/blinkerbit/aird.git
    cd aird
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install the package:**
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

## Usage

You can run Aird using the `aird` command.

### Basic Usage

To start the server with a simple access token, run:

```bash
aird --port 8888 --access-token "your-secret-token"
```

This will start the server on port 8888. You can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8888` in your web browser. You will be prompted to enter the access token to log in.

### Configuration File

You can also use a JSON file to configure Aird.

**Example `config.json`:**
```json
{
  "host": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 8080,
  "root_dir": "/path/to/your/files",
  "access_token": "your-secret-token",
  "admin_token": "your-admin-secret-token",
  "enable_ldap": false,
  "ldap_server": null,
  "ldap_base_dn": null,
  "feature_flags": {
    "file_upload": true,
    "file_delete": false,
    "file_rename": true,
    "file_download": true
  }
}
```

To run with a configuration file:
```bash
aird --config /path/to/config.json
```

### LDAP Authentication

To use LDAP authentication, you need to provide the LDAP server and base DN.

```bash
aird --enable-ldap --ldap-server "ldap://your.ldap.server" --ldap-base-dn "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
```

Users can then log in with their LDAP credentials.

    ```bash
    aird --admin-token "your-admin-secret-token"
    ```

2.  **Access the admin panel:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8888/admin` and log in with the admin token.

3.  **Manage Features:**

- [ ] **File Previews:** Add support for in-browser previews for common file types (images, PDFs, Markdown).
- [ ] **Search and Sort:** Add a search bar and make the directory listing sortable by name, size, or modification date.

### Core Functionality
- [ ] **Multi-File Operations:** Allow users to select multiple files/folders for batch actions (e.g., delete, download as zip).
- [ ] **In-Browser File Editor:** Embed a code editor like CodeMirror or Monaco to allow for in-browser text file editing.
- [ ] **User Management:** Expand to a full user management system with different roles and permissions.
- [ ] **Advanced Permissions:** Implement a role-based permission system (e.g., read-only users, upload-only users).
- [ ] **Create Files and Folders:** Add UI elements to create new empty files and folders.

### Performance
- [ ] **Asynchronous File I/O:** Use `aiofiles` to perform file operations asynchronously.
- [ ] **Pagination for Large Directories:** Implement pagination for directories with a large number of files.
