# h2ssscam
Synthetic H2 fluorescence code refactored by Cole Meyer, Daniel Lopez-Sanders, Cassandra S. Cruz, Dominik P. Pacholski during Code/Astro 2025.

The code is based on  ''Empirically estimated far-UV extinction curves for classical T Tauri stars'', McJunkin, M., France, K., Schindhelm, R., Herczeg, G., Schneider, P. C., & Brown, A. (2016), ApJ, 828, 69.

### Installation instructions
Here are some installation instructions for the average Anaconda user. (Note: in the instructions below, we will assume that you are using a virtual environment named `myenv`.) We've tested this using Python 3.10.
1. Activate your virtual environment:<br>
    `% conda activate myenv`
2. Install the `h2ssscam` package and its dependencies:<br>
    `% pip install h2ssscam`

### Usage instructions

You're now ready to use the `h2ssscam` package! To run the code, execute the following in the terminal:<br>
    `% python -m h2ssscam`

The user may also modify the input parameters for the model. To do so, navigate into the desired directory and run in the terminal<br>
    `% python -m h2ssscam.create_config_file [directory] [config file name]`<br>
If the user would like to save the config file in the current directory, they should specify `.` in place of `[directory]`. Note that the file extension for the created configuration file will always be `.ini` (even if the user specifies some other extension) to satisfy code requirements. Modify the desired parameters and run the model as usual by executing the following in the terminal:<br>
    `% python -m h2ssscam [directory]/[config file name]`

**Note that package dependencies for `h2ssscam` are managed using the `uv` package manager. Advanced users are encouraged to run `h2ssscam` using `uv` functionalities (e.g., `uv run h2ssscam`).**
