    Notes:
    1. next_tool_name must be precisely selected from the provided tool list, without adding any other characters such as quotes, brackets, etc.
    2. next_tool_args must be in valid JSON object format, wrapped in curly braces, containing key-value pairs
    3. Each field must be on a separate line, do not mix or nest fields
    4. Do not add greetings or introductions at the beginning of your answer, provide output directly in the specified format
    5. Do not use markdown code blocks (```json) to wrap your answer, provide the answer in plain text format
    6. Do not return a complete JSON object, but provide each field on a separate line according to the specified format
    7. When the task is completed, you must use the 'finish' tool to submit the final result

    next_thought: I need to search for information about deep learning
