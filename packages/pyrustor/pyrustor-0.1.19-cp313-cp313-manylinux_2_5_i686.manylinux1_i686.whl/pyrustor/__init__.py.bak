"""
PyRustor - A high-performance Python code parsing and refactoring tool written in Rust

This package provides Python bindings for the PyRustor core library,
enabling Python developers to use the high-performance Rust-based
Python code parsing and refactoring tools.

Example:
    >>> import pyrustor
    >>> parser = pyrustor.Parser()
    >>> ast = parser.parse_string("def hello(): pass")
    >>> refactor = pyrustor.Refactor(ast)
    >>> refactor.rename_function("hello", "greet")
    >>> print(refactor.get_code())

Note: This version includes improved release-please configuration.
