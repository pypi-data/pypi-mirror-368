# Yirage: Automatically Generating Fast GPU Kernels without Programming in CUDA/Triton


## About
Yirage is a tool that automatically generates fast GPU kernels for PyTorch programs through superoptimization techniques. For example, to get fast GPU kernels for attention, users only need to write a few lines of Python code to describe attention's computation. For a given PyTorch program, Yirage automatically searches the space of potential GPU kernels that are functionally equivalent to the input program and discovers highly-optimized kernel candidates. This approach allows Yirage to find new custom kernels that outperform existing expert-designed ones.

## Quick Installation

The quickest way to try Yirage is installing the latest stable release from pip:
```bash
pip install yirage-project
```

We also provide some pre-built binary wheels in the [Release Page](https://github.com/yirage-project/yirage/releases/latest). For example, to install yirage 0.2.2 compiled with CUDA 12.2 for python 3.10, using the following command:
```bash
pip install https://github.com/yirage-project/yirage/releases/download/v0.2.2/yirage_project-0.2.2+cu122-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```

You can also install Yirage from source code:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://www.github.com/yirage-project/yirage
cd yirage
pip install -e . -v
```

## Quickstart
Yirage can automatically generate fast GPU kernels for arbitrary PyTorch programs. The Yirage-generated kernels can be integrated into a PyTorch program with a few lines of code changes. As an example, we show how to use Yirage to generate  kernels that fuse [RMSNorm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07467) and Linear to accelerate Transformer-based large language model computation. More examples are available in [tutorials](https://yirage-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html).

The follow code snippet shows a native PyTorch implementation for a Transformer layer in LLaMA-3-8B.
```python
rms_norm_1 = torch.nn.RMSNorm(4096)
rms_norm_2 = torch.nn.RMSNorm(4096)
Y = rms_norm_1(X)
Z = torch.matmul(Y, Wqkv)
O = attention(Z)
U = rms_norm_2(Z)
V = torch.matmul(U, W13)
V1, V3 = V.chunk(2, -1) # split omitted in the above figure
output = torch.matmul(silu(V1) * V3, W2) # silu and this matmul omitted in the above figure
```

</p>

To accelerate Transformer computation, we can use Yirage to generate GPU kernels that fuse RMSNorm and Linear, as shown in the code snippet below. Generating optimized kernels only requires write a few lines of code to describe the desired computation. The `get_yirage_kernel` function below returns the best kernel discovered by Yirage. These kernels can directly run as functions in your PyTorch programs. This kernel is 1.5–1.7x faster than running the two operators separately in PyTorch.

```python
def get_yirage_kernel(batch_size, output_dim):
    graph = mi.new_kernel_graph()
    X = graph.new_input(dims=(batch_size, 4096), dtype=mi.float16)
    Wqkv = graph.new_input(dims=(4096, output_dim), dtype=mi.float16)
    Y = graph.rms_norm(X, normalized_shape=(4096,))
    Z = graph.matmul(Y, Wqkv)
    graph.mark_output(Y)
    return graph.superoptimize()

kernel_1 = get_yirage_kernel(batch_size, output_dim=Wqkv.shape[-1])
kernel_2 = get_yirage_kernel(batch_size, output_dim=W13.shape[-1])
Z = kernel_1(inputs=[X, Wqkv])
O = attention(Z)
V = kernel_2(inputs=[Z, W13])
V1, V3 = V.chunk(2, -1) # split omitted in the above figure
output = torch.matmul(silu(V1) * V3, W2) # silu and this matmul omitted in the above figure
```
