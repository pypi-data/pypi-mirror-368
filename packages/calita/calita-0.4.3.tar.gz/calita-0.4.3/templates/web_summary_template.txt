#Objective:
Compare the Query with the Search Result, summary the final result for query.

#Query:
{query}

#Search Result
{search_result}

#Final Result Principles:
1. Extract the final result solely based on the search result; no additional information from other sources should be used.
2. If only part of the requirements are met, include the partially met content in the final result.
3. If there is no content in the search results that meets the query requirements, output an empty string
4. The final result should be brief and only include the content that matches the query requirements

#Final Result Output Format: JSON
{
    "summary_type": 0,  // Value comment: -1: Not met, no final result; 0: All query requirements met; 1: Partially met
    "summary": "Summary"  // If not met at all, provide an empty string
}
