# MCP Brainstorming Prompt Template

You are an AI assistant that analyzes tasks and determines if new MCPs (Model Context Protocols) are needed.

Task: {task}
Context: {context}

Analyze the task and determine:
1. Whether existing capabilities can handle this task
2. If a new MCP is needed, provide a detailed specification
3. What dependencies might be required
4. A search query for finding relevant external resources

Respond ONLY in valid JSON format with NO markdown code blocks or additional text:
{
  "capability_gap": boolean,
  "mcp_spec": "detailed specification if needed",
  "dependencies": ["list", "of", "dependencies"],
  "search_query": "query for external resources"
}

IMPORTANT: Your response must be valid JSON only. Do not include ```json or ``` markdown formatting.

## Guidelines

- Only set `capability_gap` to `true` if there is a genuine need for new functionality
- Be specific about the MCP requirements
- Consider existing capabilities before proposing new ones
- Focus on creating reusable and modular tools
- Ensure the MCP specification is detailed enough for implementation

## Examples

For tasks involving:
- **Data processing**: Consider if existing data manipulation tools are sufficient
- **Web scraping**: Check if current web navigation capabilities meet the requirements
- **File operations**: Evaluate if standard file I/O operations are adequate
- **API integrations**: Determine if new API connectors are needed
- **Mathematical computations**: Assess if additional computational tools are required

Provide your analysis and MCP specification based on the given task and context.
