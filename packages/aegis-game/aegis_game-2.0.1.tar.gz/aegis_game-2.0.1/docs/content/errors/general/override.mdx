<Steps>

### Ensure You Are Using Python 3.12.10

Confirm that your virtual environment is using `Python 3.12.10` by running the following command with
the environment activated:

```bash
python --version
```

If the version shown is not `3.12.10` check your system python installations for the correct version.
If not installed, follow the [Python Guide](https://cpsc-383.github.io/aegis/guides/python/).

### Recreate the virtual environment

To ensure that your environment is properly set up, recreate your virtual environment.
Make sure you run the command in the `aegis` directory.

```bash tab="Mac/Linux"
python3 -m venv .venv

or

python3.12 -m venv .venv
```

```bash tab="Windows"
python -m venv .venv

or

py -3.12 -m venv .venv
```
