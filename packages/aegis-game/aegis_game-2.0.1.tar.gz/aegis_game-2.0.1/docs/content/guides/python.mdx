## Overview

This section shows you how to install Python 3.12.10 on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

You can use the navigation chart above to jump your OS.

## Mac

Homebrew is the best way to install Python on Mac.

<Steps>

### Check for Homebrew

Run the following command to check if Homebrew is already installed:

```bash
brew --version
```

If you see a version number, you can skip to Step 5. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

### Install Homebrew

Run the following installation script from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

You may be prompted for your macOS password.

### Add Homebrew to Your PATH

After installation, watch for this warning:

```txt
Warning: /opt/homebrew/bin is not in your PATH.
Instructions on how to configure your shell for Homebrew
can be found in the 'Next steps' section below.
```

If you see that message, run the following to configure your shell:

```bash
echo 'eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> ~/.zprofile
eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)
```

This ensures the `brew` command will work the next time you open your terminal.

### Confirm Homebrew Installation

Restart your terminal and run:

```bash
brew --version
```

You should see a version number confirming it's correctly installed.

### Install Python 3.12.10

Now install Python with:

```bash
brew install python@3.12
```

If the output mentions conflicting files or says it can't link `python@3.12`, run:

```bash
brew link --overwrite python@3.12
```

### Confirm Python Version

Verify the installation with:

```bash
python3.12 --version
```

You should see `Python 3.12.10`.

</Steps>

Now that Python 3.12.10 is installed, you're ready to [install aegis](https://cpsc-383.github.io/aegis/getting-started/installation/).

## Windows

You can install Python on Windows using the official installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31210/)

<Steps>

### Check Your Windows System Type

Before downloading Python, make sure you know whether your system is 64-bit, 32-bit, or ARM64.

If you're unsure, follow these steps to find out:

### Download the Installer

Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31210/) and scroll down to the Files section.

Choose the installer that matches your system type:

- Windows installer (64-bit) — most common
- Windows installer (32-bit)
- Windows installer (ARM64)

### Run the Installer

1. Open the downloaded installer.
2. Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" at the bottom.
3. Click Install Now.

<Callout type="warning">

If you forget to check the PATH box, Python won't work in the terminal until you fix your environment variables.

</Callout>

### Confirm the Installation

Open Command Prompt and run:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see `Python 3.12.10`.

If not, try:

```bash
py -3.12 --version
```

Still not working? Try restarting your PC and running the command again.

</Steps>

Now that Python 3.12.10 is installed, you're ready to [install aegis](https://cpsc-383.github.io/aegis/getting-started/installation/).

## Linux

You can install Python 3.12.10 on Linux using a package manager or by building from source, depending on your distro.

<Steps>

### Check Your Distro

Make sure you know which Linux distribution you're using (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch).

You can usually check with:

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

This tells you the distribution name and version.

### Option 1: Ubuntu / Debian

Ubuntu 24.04+ might already have Python 3.12. To install manually:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.12
```

Confirm with:

```bash
python3.12 --version
```

You should see `Python 3.12.10`.

### Option 2: Arch Linux

Arch users can install it directly from the AUR:

```bash
sudo pacman -Sy python312
```

This usually installs the latest version. Confirm with:

```bash
python3.12 --version
```

You should see `Python 3.12.10`.

### Option 3: Build from Source (Works on Any Distro)

If your package manager doesn't offer Python 3.12.10, you can build it from source.

#### Install Build Dependencies

Make sure you install the required development tools and libraries. The package names vary slightly by distro,
but here's a common example for Debian-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev \
  libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev uuid-dev \
  wget curl llvm tk-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils
```

Just make sure you download the equivalent dev libraries on your distro.

#### Download and Extract the Source Code

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.10/Python-3.12.10.tgz
tar -xvf Python-3.12.10.tgz
cd Python-3.12.10
```

#### Build and Install

```bash
./configure --enable-optimizations
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make altinstall
```

<Callout type="warning">

Don't use `make install` -- `make altinstall` avoids overwriting the system’s default `python3`.

</Callout>

#### Verify the Installation

Restart your terminal and run:

```bash
python3.12 --version
```

You should see `Python 3.12.10`.

#### Cleanup

Once Python is installed, you can safely remove the temporary build files:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/Python-3.12.10 /tmp/Python-3.12.10.tgz
```

</Steps>

Now that Python 3.12.10 is installed, you're ready to [install aegis](https://cpsc-383.github.io/aegis/getting-started/installation/).
