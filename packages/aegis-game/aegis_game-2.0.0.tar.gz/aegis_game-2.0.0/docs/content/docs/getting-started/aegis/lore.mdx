Welcome to the world of **Aegis**. A futuristic space station and the galaxy’s last beacon of coordinated rescue operations.

## The Goobs Initiative

The **Goobs** are a quirky but highly advanced civilization, and they've dispatched an elite space force to secure and operate **Aegis**.
A colossal orbital station that connects distant worlds through teleportation gates and high-powered scanners.

Aegis floats within a serene nebula, coordinating life-saving missions across hostile regions of space. From this hub, specially trained agents are deployed to:

- Rescue stranded survivors
- Clear dangerous rubble
- Maintain galactic peace

These agents are designed for specific tasks:

- **Commanders** oversee strategy and unit deployment
- **Engineers** clear rubble
- **Medics** extract survivors to safety

## Voidseers: The Truth Unveiled

Once members of the Goobs, the **Voidseers** are a rogue faction who claim to have discovered the *truth* about Aegis.

They believe that Aegis is not a beacon of hope, but a tool of control. A system that determines who gets saved and who is forgotten.
In their eyes, the Goobs are not rescuing the galaxy, but curating it.

Fueled by this conviction, the Voidseers have turned against their creators and try to prevent survivors from entering what they call
"the false sanctuary".

Where the Goobs see duty, Voidseers see delusion and they’ll stop at nothing to reveal the galaxy’s true fate.

## Lumens: The Currency of Life

In this universe, energy is precious. All teams rely on **Lumens**, refined stellar energy units, to power their operations.

Harvested from the remains of collapsed stars and crystallized in orbiting Lumen Forges, these radiant units are more than just fuel.
They are the foundation of all advanced technology aboard Aegis.

Agents consume Lumens to operate tools, stabilize teleportation, scan hostile terrain, and even preserve the lives of rescued survivors during transit.
Without Lumens, the station would fall silent, its gates inert and its missions doomed to fail.

Teams must manage their Lumen reserves carefully. They can be earned by saving survivors, uncovering ancient caches, or predicting ancient symbols correctly.
But beware, not all who seek Lumens do so with noble intent. The Voidseers, too, are drawn to their brilliance, believing Lumens conceal secrets about Aegis
that the Goobs refuse to acknowledge.

In the end, every decision has a cost. Every life saved and every path taken is paid for in Lumens.
