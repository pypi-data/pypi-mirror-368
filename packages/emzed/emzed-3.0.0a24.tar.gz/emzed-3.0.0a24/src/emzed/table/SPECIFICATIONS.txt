* _index always starts with 1

* indices is a mapping row_idx -> _index

* rowid does not work on views, this is why we use _index

* insertion of rows not supported, we can not shift _index without
  primary key constraint conflicts.

* addding rows happens at end of table

* deletion works for all rows
