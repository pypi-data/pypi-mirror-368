Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.","ValueSet/reference-genome-vs,ValueSet/03771a5c-12cf-49c9-ab95-cd29767a6c36,ValueSet/clinical-significance-vs,ValueSet/b14ae4af-4e18-4d78-8ccf-ae5b30791be7,ValueSet/9180fbcd-4b06-408c-9151-2cd984934a34,ValueSet/4014f494-70a1-4e20-940c-bdf6622b7d74,ValueSet/97c66dbc-e984-4e7b-a038-69919dc7c8f0,ValueSet/consent-content-code,ValueSet/0424fcd0-c4fa-4d50-a285-7d35d07d0867,ValueSet/e241214d-4bab-4559-abca-f25d56c196dc,ValueSet/observation-vitalsignresult,ValueSet/de50c457-ef80-45a1-ac9b-5db2f889c5b9,ValueSet/structural-variant-method-vs,ValueSet/zygosity-vs,ValueSet/problem-type-loinc,ValueSet/genomic-source-class-vs,ValueSet/observation-codes,ValueSet/level-of-evidence-vs,ValueSet/results-radiology-observations-uv-ips,ValueSet/0cd8450a-a933-4032-a3ac-3c316fcb1d1e,ValueSet/dna-change-type-vs,ValueSet/consent-category,ValueSet/8d77edd9-42cc-4b5b-9afc-fe90fd723cb8,ValueSet/results-radiology-txtobs-uv-ips"

Roles names are derived from the name of the playing entity in that role.    The role hierarchy stems from three core concepts, or abstract domains:     *  **RoleClassOntological** is an abstract domain that collects roles in which the playing entity is defined or specified by the scoping entity.   *  **RoleClassPartitive** collects roles in which the playing entity is in some sense a ""part"" of the scoping entity.   *  **RoleClassAssociative** collects all of the remaining forms of association between the playing entity and the scoping entity. This set of roles is further partitioned between:             *  **RoleClassPassive** which are roles in which the playing entity is used, known, treated, handled, built, or destroyed, etc. under the auspices of the scoping entity. The playing entity is passive in these roles in that the role exists without an agreement from the playing entity.       *  **RoleClassMutualRelationship** which are relationships based on mutual behavior of the two entities. The basis of these relationship may be formal agreements or they may be *de facto* behavior. Thus, this sub-domain is further divided into:                     *  **RoleClassRelationshipFormal** in which the relationship is formally defined, frequently by a contract or agreement.           *  **Personal relationship** which inks two people in a personal relationship.

All approved symbols are stored in the HGNC database,[www.genenames.org](https://www.genenames.org/tools/search), a curated online repository of HGNC-approved gene nomenclature, gene groups and associated resources including links to genomic, proteomic and phenotypic information. Each symbol is unique and we ensure that each gene is only given one approved gene symbol. It is necessary to provide a unique symbol for each gene so that we and others can talk about them, and this also facilitates electronic data retrieval from publications and databases.""    HGNC also provides an index on gene families/groups. GeneGroup IDs do not begin with ""HGNC:"", so care must be made to ensure alignment of concepts when viewing an HGNC ID from an older system that may be referring to the GeneID and not a gene group. For example, 588 refers to the HLA gene family, but HGNC:588 identifies the ATG12 gene. To provide clarity for systems that do not distinguish codes from genes and gene families, use ""http://www.genenames.org"" for genes and ""http://www.genenames.org/genegroup"" for gene families as code system URIs.    For more information on HGNC Gene Groups, see [https://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem-HGNCGeneGroup.html](https://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem-HGNCGeneGroup.html).    Historically, HGNC gene symbols were used with the HL7 coded data type. For example, in the HL7 messages specified according to the HL7 V2 Clinical Genomics Fully LOINC-Qualified Genetic Variation Model Implementation Guide, HGNC gene symbols were used as the observation values for gene identifiers. For example, OBX 1 CWE 48018-6^Gene identifier^ BRCA1^HGNC. Please note that gene symbols may be present in legacy systems, but GeneID should be used to exchange HGNC gene information in current implementations.    HGNC is a free database for the public.    Versioning Information: The version of the HGNC database is reported using the last updated date. The last updated date is posted on the main HGNC Search screen in the format like ""2024-07-25"".    Current, monthly and quarterly HGNC dataset files are published.    Please see https://www.genenames.org/ for more info.","ValueSet/hgnc-vs"

http://www.sequenceontology.org,1.0.0,active,,SO,Sequence Ontology,"""The Sequence Ontology is a set of terms and relationships used to describe the features and attributes of biological sequence. SO includes different kinds of features which can be located on the sequence. Biological features are those which are defined by their disposition to be involved in a biological process.""    ""The Sequence Ontologies are provided as a resource to the biological community. They have the following obvious uses:    * To provide for a structured controlled vocabulary for the description of primary annotations of nucleic acid sequence, e.g. the annotations shared by a DAS server ([BioDAS](http://www.biodas.org/documents/das2/das2_protocol.html), [Biosapiens DAS](http://www.biosapiens.info/page.php?page=das_portal)), or annotations encoded by [GFF3](http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml).""    * To provide for a structured representation of these annotations within databases. Were genes within model organism databases to be annotated with these terms then it would be possible to query all these databases for, for example, all genes whose transcripts are edited, or trans-spliced, or are bound by a particular protein. One such genomic database is [Chado](http://www.gmod.org/wiki/Chado).    * To provide a structured controlled vocabulary for the description of mutations at both the sequence and more gross level in the context of genomic databases.""    ""The Sequence Ontology is part of [OBO](http://www.obofoundry.org/).
