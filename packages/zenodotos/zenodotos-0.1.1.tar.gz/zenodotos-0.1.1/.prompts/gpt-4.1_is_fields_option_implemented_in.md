Hello! Is the option --fields for quill's list-files command implemented?

---

**Cursor**

No, the `--fields` option is not currently implemented for Quill's `list-files` command.

- The `list_files` command in `src/quill/cli.py` does not accept any arguments or options, including `--fields`.
- However, the underlying `DriveClient.list_files()` method does support a `fields` parameter, so the backend is capable of handling custom fields if the CLI is updated to expose this option.

If you want, I can implement the `--fields` option for the CLI, allowing you to specify which fields to retrieve for each file. Let me know if you'd like to proceed!

**User**

Yes, please, proceed, considering I want to keep the current  fields selected in the code as the default option.

Hereâ€™s the plan to implement the `--fields` option for `list-files`:

- Add a `--fields` option to the CLI, accepting a comma-separated list.
- If not provided, use the current default fields (`id`, `name`, `mimeType`, `size`, `createdTime`, `modifiedTime`, `description`, `owners`, `webViewLink`).
- Always ensure `name`, `mimeType`, and `size` are included, since the formatter requires them.
- Pass the resulting list to `DriveClient.list_files`.
- Update the help text for clarity.

I will now implement this in `src/quill/cli.py`.

```python
// ... existing code ...

@cli.command()
@click.option(
    "--fields",
    default=None,
    help="Comma-separated list of fields to retrieve for each file. Defaults to all standard fields. Required fields for display (name, mimeType, size) are always included."
)
def list_files(fields):
    """List files in your Google Drive."""
    # Default fields as in DriveClient
    default_fields = [
        "id",
        "name",
        "mimeType",
        "size",
        "createdTime",
        "modifiedTime",
        "description",
        "owners",
        "webViewLink",
    ]
    required_fields = {"name", "mimeType", "size"}
    if fields:
        user_fields = set(f.strip() for f in fields.split(",") if f.strip())
        all_fields = list(required_fields | user_fields)
    else:
        all_fields = default_fields
    client = DriveClient()
    result = client.list_files(fields=all_fields)
    click.echo(format_file_list(result["files"]))
// ... existing code ...
```

This is not the right way to run the tests in this project

---

**Cursor**

The error message indicates that `pytest` is not currently installed in your environment, which is why the test command failed.

**Next steps:**
- Install the development dependencies as described in the README with:
  ```bash
  pip install -e ".[dev]"
  ```
- Then, rerun the test command:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=src/quill --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80
  ```

Would you like me to proceed with installing the development dependencies and running the tests, or would you prefer to handle the installation yourself?

```shellscript
  pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

```shellscript
  pytest --cov=src/quill --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80
```

The development environment is already created, you may need to activate it before running the tests or any other check

Thank you for clarifying! To proceed, I will activate the virtual environment and then run the tests with coverage as specified in your README.

The tests ran successfully with 29 passing, 1 skipped, and overall coverage at 85% (above the required 80%). This confirms that the new `--fields` option for `list-files` is compatible and does not break existing functionality.

**Summary of what was done:**
- Added a `--fields` option to the `list-files` command, defaulting to the current fields if not specified.
- Ensured required fields for display are always included.
- Verified the implementation with the project's test suite and coverage requirements.

**Next steps:**
- If you want, I can add or update tests to specifically cover the new `--fields` CLI option, as the coverage for `src/quill/cli.py` is currently low (47%).
- You may also want to review or unskip the currently skipped CLI test.

Would you like to proceed with improving CLI test coverage or is this sufficient for now?
