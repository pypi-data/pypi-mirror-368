Hello! Is the option --fields for quill's list-files command implemented?

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you check if the `--fields` option is implemented for quill's `list-files` command. Let me explore the project structure and examine the relevant code.

This appears to be a Python project. Let me examine the source code structure and look for the quill command implementation.

Now let me examine the quill package structure and CLI implementation:

Let me examine the drive client and formatters to understand the current implementation:

Now let me examine the key files to understand the current implementation:

Now let me check the tests to see if there are any tests for the `--fields` option:

Based on my examination of the code, I can answer your question:

**No, the `--fields` option is NOT implemented for quill's `list-files` command at the CLI level.**

Here's what I found:

## Current Implementation Status

1. **CLI Level**: The `list-files` command in `src/quill/cli.py` does not have any command-line options defined, including `--fields`:

```python
@cli.command()
def list_files():
    """List files in your Google Drive."""
    client = DriveClient()
    result = client.list_files()
    click.echo(format_file_list(result["files"]))
```

2. **Backend Support**: However, the underlying `DriveClient.list_files()` method in `src/quill/drive/client.py` **does support** a `fields` parameter:

```32:40:src/quill/drive/client.py
    def list_files(
        self,
        page_size: int = 10,
        page_token: Optional[str] = None,
        query: Optional[str] = None,
        fields: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

3. **Documentation Mismatch**: Interestingly, the `README.md` mentions the `--fields` option as if it were already implemented:

```81:81:README.md
- `--fields`: Comma-separated list of fields to include in the response
```

4. **Testing**: The backend `fields` parameter is thoroughly tested in `tests/unit/drive/test_client.py`, confirming that the functionality works at the API client level.

## Summary

The `--fields` option is **not implemented** at the CLI command level, but the underlying infrastructure supports it. To implement this feature, you would need to:

1. Add a `@click.option('--fields')` decorator to the `list_files` command
2. Pass the fields parameter to the `DriveClient.list_files()` method
3. Potentially update the display formatter to handle different field sets

The backend is ready for this feature - it just needs to be exposed through the CLI interface.

```python
@cli.command()
def list_files():
    """List files in your Google Drive."""
    client = DriveClient()
    result = client.list_files()
    click.echo(format_file_list(result["files"]))
```

```python
    def list_files(
        self,
        page_size: int = 10,
        page_token: Optional[str] = None,
        query: Optional[str] = None,
        fields: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```
