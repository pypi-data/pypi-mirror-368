# SPAM - A <u>S</u>oftware <u>PA</u>ckage <u>M</u>anager #

To be honest it's not *really* a package manager,
but merely a wrapper that presents a uniform command-line interface
across Linux distros and a few other Unixy things.


## Usage & Features ##

üëâ  Easy to type and use every day.
For example, to operate on the *foo* package:

```sh
‚èµ spam -h               # usage and additional/customized cmd list

‚èµ spam up               # or update; upgrade
‚èµ spam in foo           # or install
‚èµ spam rm foo           # or uninstall
‚èµ spam clean            # clean up downloads and autoremove

# Moar!
‚èµ spam add foo://bar    # add repo
‚èµ spam info foo         # or show
‚èµ spam lsf foo          # or listfiles
‚èµ spam pr /bin/foo      # or provides, what or who-owns file
‚èµ spam pu foo           # or purge
‚èµ spam se foo           # or search
```

üëâ  It knows when to invoke sudo,
so you rarely need to worry about it.

üëâ  It prints the command it runs,
so you can learn how to do it on a package manager you may not be as familiar
with.
Also, if it wasn't able to do what you want,
it is easier to tweak the next command.


## Support ##

Currently supports:

- apt - Linux/Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
- dnf - Linux/Fedora
- opkg - Linux/OpenWRT
- port - MacOS/MacPorts

With hopefully more to come as time allows.
Probably works on WSL.
