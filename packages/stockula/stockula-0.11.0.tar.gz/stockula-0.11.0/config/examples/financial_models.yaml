  # FAST_FINANCIAL_MODEL_LIST (15-30s per symbol):
  # - LastValueNaive: Very fast (<1s) - Uses last value as forecast
  # - AverageValueNaive: Very fast (<1s) - Moving average approach
  # - SeasonalNaive: Fast (<5s) - Captures seasonal patterns
  # - ETS: Fast (5-10s) - Exponential smoothing (Error/Trend/Seasonality)
  # - ARIMA: Moderate (10-20s) - AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average
  # - Theta: Fast (5-10s) - Statistical decomposition method

# Full FINANCIAL_MODEL_LIST adds (2-5min per symbol):
# - GLS, VAR, VECM, NVAR (advanced statistical models)
# - RollingRegression, WindowRegression (adaptive regression)
# - DynamicFactor, MotifSimulation, SectionalMotif (pattern-based)
# Note: FBProphet and ARDL are excluded to avoid permission/numerical issues
