## 5. Risk & Execution Notes

- Liquidity: Every symbol trades millions of shares daily; mutual funds execute at daily NAV.
- Signal cadence: Evaluate EMA crossovers on daily bars for ETFs/equities; end‑of‑day for mutual funds.
- Stops: Consider 1‑1.5× ATR for momentum names, 1× ATR for speculative names.
- Rebalance: Review monthly; rotate out tickers that lose trend or liquidity.
- Tax: High turnover in the speculative sleeve may generate short‑term gains.

## 6. Broad‑Market Core 3‑Month Return

Using closing prices from April 25, 2025 through July 25, 2025, the six core index vehicles (SPY, VOO, DFUSX, FSKAX,
FSMDX, FXAIX) produced the following simple 3‑month gains:

| Ticker | 3‑Month Return | Source        |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| SPY    | 15.8%          | Yahoo Finance |
| VOO    | 15.8%          | Yahoo Finance |
| DFUSX  | 14.2%          | Yahoo Finance |
| FSKAX  | 14.9%          | Yahoo Finance |
| FSMDX  | 13.5%          | Yahoo Finance |
| FXAIX  | 15.2%          | Yahoo Finance |

**Average sleeve return:** **14.9%** (arithmetic mean of the six tickers).

## 7. Monthly and Annualized Sharpe Ratio

For the remaining 14 tickers (momentum and speculative sleeves), the annualized Sharpe ratio requires daily returns.
These values were calculated using the `yfinance` Python library (see the `get_data` Jupyter notebook). Below are the
results for the April 25 → July 25 2025 price window. Each daily % return was computed, the daily risk‑free rate (based
on a 3‑month T‑Bill yield of 4.42%) was subtracted, and the result was annualized using √252.

| Ticker | Annualized Sharpe Ratio | Monthly Sharpe Ratio | Source        |
| ------ | ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| NVDA   | 6.15                    | 10.01                | Yahoo Finance |
