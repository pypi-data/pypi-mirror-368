# dicodon_optimizer

Optimize your gene sequence using di-codon optimization.


## Description

Using the wrong codons for your target organism will yield
(very) suboptimal gene expression.

There's even a dependency on codon order (or 'dicodons').

This library has pretty much been superseeded by <a href="https://github.com/TyberiusPrime/dicodon_optimizer_wasm">dicodon-optimizer-wasm</a>,
but if you must do it in python, it might still be useful.
