## Features

- Simple and lightweight Python package
- Accurate distance calculation on Earthâ€™s surface (in kilometers)
- Easy to integrate into any Python project
- Well-tested with unit tests included

---

## Installation

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install min_distance
```

---

## Usage

```python
from min_distance import calculate_min_distance

lat1, lon1 = 40.7128, -74.0060  # New York
lat2, lon2 = 51.5074, -0.1278   # London

distance_km = calculate_min_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)
print(f"Distance: {distance_km:.2f} km")
```

## API Reference

### `calculate_min_distance(lat1: float, lon1: float, lat2: float, lon2: float) -> float`

Calculate the minimum distance between two points on the Earth specified by latitude and longitude.

- **Parameters:**
  - `lat1`, `lon1`: Latitude and Longitude of the first point in decimal degrees.
  - `lat2`, `lon2`: Latitude and Longitude of the second point in decimal degrees.

- **Returns:** Distance in kilometers as a `float`.
