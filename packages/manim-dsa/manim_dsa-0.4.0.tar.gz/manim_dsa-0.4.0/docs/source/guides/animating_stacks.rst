Animating Stacks
================

Manim Stack - MStack
--------------------

In this section, you'll find all the methods available to manipulate a ``MStack`` (short for Manim Stack ðŸ˜„). Like all ``MObject`` structures, you can animate these methods using the ``.animate`` method, allowing you to animate each operation provided by Manim DSA.
Otherwise, methods will run without any animations.

You can also access each element in a ``MStack`` using the ``[]`` operator and specifying the elementâ€™s index.

Creating a MStack
------------------

To represent a stack, initialize an object of type ``MStack``. As the first parameter, provide a list of values to insert into the ``MStack``. Optionally, you can specify the distance between each element and customize the theme of the ``MStack`` (see :ref:`customizing_a_mstack`).

Here's an example that creates a ``MStack`` with a list of five numbers.

.. manim:: Creation
    :quality: high

    from manim_dsa import *
    
    class Creation(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            mStack = MStack([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).scale(0.7)
            self.play(Create(mStack))
            self.wait()

Customizing a MStack
--------------------

ManimDSA provides various options for customizing the colors and styles of a MStack. You can use these options by passing a predefined style configuration from the ``MStackStyle`` class using the ``style`` parameter. Refer to ``MStackStyle`` for more details. Alternatively, you can define a custom style to suit your needs.

In the following example, we use the ``GREEN`` style for the ``MStack``.

.. manim:: CustomCreation
    :quality: high

    from manim_dsa import *

    class CustomCreation(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            mStack = MStack(
                [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
                style=MStackStyle.GREEN
            ).scale(0.7)
            self.play(Create(mStack))
            self.wait()

Inserting an element to a MStack
--------------------------------

The ``append()`` method allows you to insert an element in a ``MStack``. The new element automatically inherits the properties specified in the configuration dictionaries.

In the example below, we create a ``MStack`` and then use the ``append()`` method to insert a new element.

.. manim:: Append
    :quality: high

    from manim_dsa import *

    class Append(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            mStack = (
                MStack(
                    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
                    style=MStackStyle.BLUE,
                ).scale(0.7)
            )
            self.play(Create(mStack))
            self.play(mStack.animate.append(6))
            self.wait()

Removing an element from a MStack
---------------------------------

The ``pop()`` method allows you to remove the last element inserted in a ``MStack``, as you can see in the example below.

.. manim:: Pop
    :quality: high

    from manim_dsa import *

    class Pop(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            mStack = (
                MStack(
                    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
                    style=MStackStyle.BLUE
                )#.scale(0.7) for some strange reason it's not needed T_T
            )
            self.play(Create(mStack))
            self.play(mStack.animate.pop())
            self.wait()
