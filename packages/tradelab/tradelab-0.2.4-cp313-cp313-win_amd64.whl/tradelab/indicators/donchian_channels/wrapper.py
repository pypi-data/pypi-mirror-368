    """
    Calculate Donchian Channels using Cython for performance.

    Donchian Channels are volatility indicators that show the highest high and 
    lowest low over a specific period, creating dynamic support and resistance levels.

    Parameters
    ----------
    high : array-like
        High prices (numpy array or pandas Series)
    low : array-like
        Low prices (numpy array or pandas Series)
    period : int, optional
        The lookback period for calculating channels (default: 20)

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame with columns:
        - Upper: Highest high over the period
        - Middle: Average of upper and lower channels
        - Lower: Lowest low over the period

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from tradelab.indicators.donchian_channels import DONCHIAN_CHANNELS
    >>> 
    >>> # Sample OHLC data
    >>> high = pd.Series([12, 13, 14, 13, 15, 16, 15, 17, 16, 18])
    >>> low = pd.Series([10, 11, 12, 11, 13, 14, 13, 15, 14, 16])
    >>> 
    >>> # Calculate 20-period Donchian Channels
    >>> channels = DONCHIAN_CHANNELS(high, low, period=20)
    >>> print(channels)

    Notes
    -----
    - Upper channel = Highest high over the lookback period
    - Lower channel = Lowest low over the lookback period  
    - Middle channel = (Upper + Lower) / 2
    - Common periods: 10, 20, 55 days
    - Used for trend following and breakout strategies
    - This implementation uses Cython for optimized performance
