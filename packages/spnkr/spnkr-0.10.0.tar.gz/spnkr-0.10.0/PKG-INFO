# Welcome to SPNKr

## About

[SPNKr](https://www.halopedia.org/M41_SPNKr) is a Python wrapper around the undocumented Halo Infinite web API. This is a personal project with the goal of analyzing Halo Infinite matchmaking data. It is not in any way official or connected to Microsoft/343 Industries and does not provide any guarantees of completeness or API availability. Use at your own risk. The functionality is available via a public repository on GitHub and as a package published to PyPI.
