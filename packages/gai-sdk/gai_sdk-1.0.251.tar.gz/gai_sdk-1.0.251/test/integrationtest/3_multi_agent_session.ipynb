Together, they spent three days carefully transporting each precious egg to a hidden cave deep within the Whispering Peaks, and when their task was complete, Pyrion gifted Elara a single iridescent scale as a token of their unlikely friendship, proving that sometimes the greatest victories come not from conquest, but from compassion.\\n\"\n",
