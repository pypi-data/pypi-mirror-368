class Store:
    """
    The `Store` class represents a data store with different modes of persistence 
    and distribution. It includes subclasses for in-memory and persistent storage 
    options, with further distinctions for distributed versions of each. These 
    variations allow for flexible data storage configurations based on persistence 
    and distribution needs.

    Attributes:
        No direct attributes, but subclasses inherit from `generic_kv`, which 
        handles key-value store functionality.

    Methods:
        InMemory: A subclass for an in-memory data store.
        Persistent: A subclass for a persistent data store, which persists data 
                    across sessions or server restarts.

            persistent (bool): Always False for in-memory stores.
            distributed (bool): Always False for the basic in-memory store.
