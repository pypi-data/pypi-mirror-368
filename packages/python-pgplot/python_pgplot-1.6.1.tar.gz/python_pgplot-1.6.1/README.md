# ppgplot

ppgplot - The Pythonic interface to PGPLOT, with support for both PGPLOT and Giza backends.

`ppgplot` is a python module (extension) providing bindings to the PGPLOT
graphics library. PGPLOT is a scientific visualization (graphics) library
written in Fortran by T. J. Pearson. C bindings for PGPLOT are also available.
`ppgplot` makes the library usable by Python programs. It had support for the Numeric /
numarray modules, but nowadays (>= Feb 2025) replaced by Numpy, to efficiently represent and
manipulate vectors and matrices.

## Installing

Since `v1.5` (Apr 2025) the package should be `pip`-installable; it's a package on the [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/python-pgplot/):

```bash
    $> pip install python-pgplot
    $> python3
    >>> import ppgplot
    >>>
```
**NOTE: Due to a package name collision, the PyPI project name is `python-pgplot`; the obvious package name was already claimed by something completely different**


It is also possible to build the package from this `git`-repository. You may need to create a Python [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) first. See below for detailed instructions.

```bash
    $> pip install [-e] .
```

**Note:** there is a [separate old-python-3.6 branch](https://github.com/haavee/ppgplot/tree/old-python-3.6) based off master, with a how-to in the commit log(s). Of course nothing works out of the box on that system - only succeeded using an (old) Anaconda3.6 base package. YMMV.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- numpy >= 1.21.0
- PGPLOT or Giza libraries installed
- X11 development libraries
- pkg-config 

### Installing the dependencies

On Linux use your favourite package manager, e.g.:
```bash
$> sudo apt-get install giza-dev libx11-dev pkg-config
```

Successful installation using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on Mac OSX with:
```bash
$> brew install libx11 giza pkgconf
```

## Installation

In principle, this extension should build out-of-the-box in a Python `venv`, or, if you have it, a `conda` virtual environment (untested at the moment).
The [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) file lists all dependencies and should (...) pull them into the `venv` as required for building/deploying:

```bash
$> cd /path/to/checkout/of/this/repo
$> pip install [-e] .
```

Without `-e` installs the extension in the `venv`, with the `-e` keeps the module in the current directory.


## Using a bespoke PGPLOT or Giza backend

The extension configuration allows compiling + linking to a locally compiled [PGPLOT](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/) or [Giza](https://github.com/danieljprice/giza) library.


Obviously, first install or build PGPLOT and/or Giza on your system (should you want to compare them).
Then build the extension, pointing the `PGPLOT_DIR` environment variable to the installation directory of the backend of choice:

```bash
$> PGPLOT_DIR=/path/to/pgplot pip install [-e] . 
```

## Notes

FORTRAN? Srsly? Actually, for plotting large numbers of points or simple, yet precise control of the graphics, the FORTRAN based PGPLOT backend is convenient and _fast_ (a _lot_ faster than `matplotlib`, and still noticeably faster than `Giza`). However, the upside of investing those compute cycles is that the (anti-aliased!) fonts and graphics produced by the [`cairo`](https://www.cairographics.org) library (the _actual_ graphics backend used by `Giza`) are of an amazing quality.

If `ppgplot` is linked against the `Giza` library, it can produce output in `.png` and `.pdf`, also not something to be sneezed at.

All in all, the `Giza` backend is an amazing job done, but it is [not 100% compatible with the original PGPLOT](https://danieljprice.github.io/giza/documentation/pgplot.html), so it is not guaranteed your plots will come out identical.

This fork of the Python-extension owes a lot of thanks to the original author, Nick Patavalis, of `ppgplot`:
