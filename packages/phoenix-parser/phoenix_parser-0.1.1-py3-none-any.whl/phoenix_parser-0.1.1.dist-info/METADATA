              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Phoenix: A Resilient Semantic Parser for LLM Output

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/phoenix-parser.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/phoenix-parser/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/phoenix-parser.svg)](https://github.com/shalyhinpavel/phoenix/blob/main/LICENSE)
[![Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/phoenix-parser.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/phoenix-parser/)

Getting reliable structured data from Large Language Models (LLMs) is a fundamental engineering challenge. When an LLM's output deviates even slightly from a strict JSON format, traditional parsers fail.

Phoenix is a lightweight, dependency-free library that intelligently extracts structured data from messy or incomplete LLM outputs. It doesn't just follow rules—it understands and recovers.

---

## Key Features

*   **Resilience Cascade:** A three-layer defense system to ensure you always get a result.
*   **Intelligent Cleaning:** Automatically handles common LLM errors like comments, trailing commas, and "smart" quotes.
*   **Semantic Recovery:** As a last resort, it scans unstructured text to find key-value pairs and rebuilds the data from scratch.
*   **Pydantic Integration:** Leverages Pydantic for robust validation of the final output.
*   **Lightweight & Fast:** Zero dependencies besides Pydantic, ensuring easy integration.

---

## How It Works: The Resilience Cascade

Phoenix processes LLM output through three layers of defense:

1.  **Markdown Search:** It first looks for JSON inside standard ```json ... ``` code blocks.
2.  **Direct Parsing & Cleaning:** It then attempts to parse the output as clean JSON, automatically removing common syntax errors like comments.
3.  **Semantic Extraction:** If all else fails, Phoenix activates its superpower: it analyzes the raw, unstructured text, finds `key: value` pairs, and reconstructs the data.

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install phoenix-parser
```

---

## Quickstart

Here's how to use Phoenix to reliably parse data from a messy LLM output.

```python
from phoenix_parser import AdaptiveSemanticParser, ParsingError
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# 1. Define your desired data structure using Pydantic
class UserProfile(BaseModel):
    user_name: str = Field(description="The full name of the user.")
    user_id: int = Field(description="The unique user identifier.")
    is_active: bool = Field(description="The active status of the user account.")

# 2. Get a messy, real-world output from an LLM
messy_llm_output = """
Here are the user details you requested.
// User is confirmed active.
```json
{
  “user_name”: “Alice”,
  “user_id”: "123", // ID is a string, needs to be an int!
  “is_active”: true, // Trailing comma...
}
```
Let me know if you need anything else!
"""

# 3. Create a parser instance and parse the data
parser = AdaptiveSemanticParser()

try:
    # Phoenix will automatically clean, parse, and validate the data
    validated_data = parser.parse(messy_llm_output, UserProfile)
    
    print("✅ Successfully parsed and validated!")
    print(validated_data)
    # Output: {'user_name': 'Alice', 'user_id': 123, 'is_active': True}
    
    assert isinstance(validated_data['user_id'], int)
    
except ParsingError as e:
    print(f"❌ Failed to parse data: {e}")

```

## Comparison with Classic Parsers

| Feature               | Classic Parsers (e.g., `json.loads`)                      | The Phoenix Parser                                       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Technology**        | Rigid grammars                                            | Hybrid: Direct parsing + Semantic understanding          |
| **Flexibility**       | Low (breaks on syntax errors)                             | High (handles messy structures, comments, etc.)          |
| **Failure Response**  | Hard `JSONDecodeError`                                    | Semantic data recovery                                   |
| **Paradigm**          | "Fixing chaos with rules."                                | "Using intelligence to understand chaos."                |
