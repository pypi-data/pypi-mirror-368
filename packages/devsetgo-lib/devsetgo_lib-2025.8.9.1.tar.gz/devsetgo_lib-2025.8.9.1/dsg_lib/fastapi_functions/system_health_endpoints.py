"""
This module provides a configurable health endpoint for a FastAPI application.
It includes the following routes:

- `/api/health/status`: Returns the status of the application. If the
  application is running, it will return `{"status": "UP"}`. This endpoint can
  be enabled or disabled using the configuration.

- `/api/health/uptime`: Returns the uptime of the application in a dictionary
  with the keys "Days", "Hours", "Minutes", and "Seconds". The uptime is
  calculated from the time the application was started. This endpoint can be
  enabled or disabled using the configuration.

- `/api/health/heapdump`: Returns a heap dump of the application. The heap dump
  is a list of dictionaries, each representing a line of code. Each dictionary
  includes the filename, line number, size of memory consumed, and the number of
  times the line is referenced. This endpoint can be enabled or disabled using
  the configuration.

The module uses the `FastAPI`, `time`, `tracemalloc`, `loguru`, `packaging`, and
`dsg_lib.fastapi.http_codes` modules.

Functions:
    create_health_router(config: dict) -> FastAPI.APIRouter:
        Creates a FastAPI router with health endpoints based on the provided
        configuration.

Example:
    ```python
    from FastAPI import FastAPI
    from dsg_lib.fastapi_functions import
    system_health_endpoints

    app = FastAPI()

    # User configuration
    config = {
        "enable_status_endpoint": True,
        "enable_uptime_endpoint": False,
        "enable_heapdump_endpoint": True,
    }

    # Health router
    health_router =
    system_health_endpoints.create_health_router(config)
    app.include_router(health_router, prefix="/api/health",
    tags=["system-health"])

    # Get the status of the application
    response = client.get("/api/health/status")
    print(response.json())  # {"status": "UP"}

    # Get the uptime of the application response =
    client.get("/api/health/uptime")
    print(response.json())
    # {"uptime": {"Days": 0, "Hours": 0, "Minutes": 1, "Seconds": 42.17}}

    # Get the heap dump of the application response =
    client.get("/api/health/heapdump")
    print(response.json())
    # {"memory_use":{"current": "123456", "peak": "789012"}, "heap_dump": [{"filename": "main.py", "lineno": 10, "size": 1234, "count": 1}, ...]}

    Create a health router with the following endpoints:

    - `/status`: Returns the status of the application. This endpoint can be
      enabled or disabled using the `enable_status_endpoint` key in the

    - `/uptime`: Returns the uptime of the application. This endpoint can be
      enabled or disabled using the `enable_uptime_endpoint` key in the
      configuration.
