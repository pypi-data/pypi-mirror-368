title: PCI Bus Common Properties

description: |
  Common properties for PCI bus structure.

  PCI bus bridges have standardized Device Tree bindings:

  PCI Bus Binding to: IEEE Std 1275-1994
  http://www.devicetree.org/open-firmware/bindings/pci/pci2_1.pdf

  And for the interrupt mapping part:

  external-facing:
    description:
      When present, the port is externally facing. All bridges and endpoints
      downstream of this port are external to the machine. The OS can, for
      example, use this information to identify devices that cannot be
      trusted with relaxed DMA protection, as users could easily attach
      malicious devices to this port.

  max-link-speed:
    description:
      If present this property specifies PCI generation number for link
      capability.  Host drivers could add this as a strategy to avoid
      unnecessary operation for unsupported link speed, for instance, trying to
      do training for unsupported link speed, etc.

      Receiver (this component) when transitioning the Link from L0s
      to L0; advertised during initial Link training. Each entry in
      the array specifies a PCIe data rate

      This property is invalid in host bridge nodes.

  supports-clkreq:
    description:
      If present this property specifies that CLKREQ signal routing exists from
      root port to downstream device and host bridge drivers can do programming
      which depends on CLKREQ signal existence. For example, programming root port
      not to advertise ASPM L1 Sub-States support if there is no CLKREQ signal.
