description:
  This binding describes generic properties a consumer of the channels
  provided by an IIO device may use.

  As well, direct readings of channels on an IIO Device, an IIO device
  can provide services to consumer devices. They are in the form of channel
  readings and properties.  For example, an ADC might provide 3 channels to
  an analog accelerometer so that an accelerometer driver can use them to
  read the voltages that correspond to the accelerations on the 3 axis and
  apply appropriate calibration to provide useful outputs.

  It also describes properties of a consumer of an IIO backend device.

      List of phandle and IIO specifier pairs, one pair for each IIO input
      to the device. Note: if the IIO provider specifies '0' for
      #io-channel-cells, then only the phandle portion of the pair will appear.

    description:
      List of phandles for IIO backends. IIO backends are devices connected to
      another IIO devices (consumers of the backends) providing services so
      that the consumer IIO device can be fully functional. One typical example
      of such an Hardware arrangement would be an high speed ADC that is
      connected to an FPGA IP core (through a serial data interface as LVDS)
      capable of handling the high sample rates. Examples of the provided
      services would be channel enablement/disablement.
