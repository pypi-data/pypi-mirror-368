description:
  A trigger source providers are an abstraction for anything that provides a
  signal to trigger an event. For example, this could be a disk activity signal
  that triggers a LED to turn on or off or it could be a data ready signal
  that triggers a SPI offload to read data without a software interrupt. Each
  trigger source provider should be represented by a device tree node.
