          Name of the system state. These are the available states:
          - standby: Light suspend, peripherals may remain active
          - mem-mcu-active: DDR in self-refresh, MCU/coprocessor running,
            main cores off
          - mem: DDR in self-refresh, all cores off
          - mem-deep: DDR in self-refresh, all other hardware off except
            some wake logic
          - off-wake: System powered off, wake-up logic remains active
          - off: Complete power off, lowest possible power state
        enum:
          - standby
