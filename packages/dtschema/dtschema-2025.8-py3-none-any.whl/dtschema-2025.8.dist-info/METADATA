# Devicetree Schema Tools

The dtschema module contains tools and schema data for Devicetree
schema validation using the
[json-schema](https://json-schema.org) vocabulary.
The tools validate Devicetree files using DT binding schema files. The
tools also validate the DT binding schema files. Schema files are
written in a JSON compatible subset of YAML to be both human and machine
readable.

## Data Model

To understand how validation works, it is important to understand how
schema data is organized and used. If you're reading this, I assume
you're already familiar with Devicetree and the .dts file format.

In this repository you will find 2 kinds of data files; *Schemas* and
*Meta-Schemas*.

### *Devicetree Schemas*

Found under `./dtschema/schemas`

*Devicetree Schemas* describe the format of devicetree data.
The raw Devicetree file format is very open ended and doesn't restrict how
data is encoded.Hence, it is easy to make mistakes when writing a
Devicetree. Schema files impose the constraints on what data can be put
into a Devicetree.

This repository contains the 'core' schemas which consists of DT
properties defined within the DT Specification and common bindings such
as the GPIO, clock, and PHY bindings.

This repository does not contain device specific bindings. Those are
currently maintained within the Linux kernel tree alongside Devicetree
files (.dts).

When validating, the tool will load all the schema files it can find and then
iterate over all the nodes of the Devicetree.
For each node, the tool will determine which schema(s) are applicable and make sure
the node data matches the schema constraints.
Nodes failing a schema test will emit an error.
Nodes that don't match any schema can emit a warning.

As a developer, you would write a Devicetree schema file for each new
device binding that you create and add it to the `./schemas` directory.

Schema files also have the dual purpose of documenting a binding.
When you define a new binding, you only have to create one file that contains
both the machine-verifiable data format and the documentation.

Devicetree Schema files are normal YAML files using the jsonschema vocabulary.

The Devicetree Schema files are simplified to make them more compact.

The default for arrays in json-schema is they are variable sized. This can be
restricted by defining 'minItems', 'maxItems', and 'additionalItems'. For
DeviceTree Schemas, a fixed size is desired in most cases, so these properties
are added based on the size of 'items' list.

### *Devicetree Meta-Schemas*

Found in `./dtschema/meta-schemas`

*Devicetree Meta-Schemas* describe the data format of Devicetree Schema files.
The Meta-schemas make sure all the binding schemas are in the correct format
and the tool will emit an error if the format is incorrect. json-schema
by default is very relaxed in terms of what is allowed in schemas. Unknown
keywords are silently ignored as an example. The DT Meta-schemas are designed
to limit what is allowed and catch common errors in writing schemas.

As a developer you normally will not need to write metaschema files.

Devicetree Meta-Schema files are normal YAML files using the jsonschema vocabulary.

## Usage
There are several tools available in the *tools/* directory.

`tools/dt-doc-validate`
This tool takes a schema file(s) or directory of schema files and validates
them against the DT meta-schema.

Example:
```
dt-doc-validate -u test/schemas test/schemas/good-example.yaml
```

`tools/dt-mk-schema`
This tool takes user-provided schema file(s) plus the core schema files in this
repo, removes everything not needed for validation, applies fix-ups to the
schemas, and outputs a single file with the processed schema. This step
is optional and can be done separately to speed up subsequent validation
of Devicetrees.

Example:
```
dt-mk-schema -j test/schemas/ > processed-schema.json
```

`tools/dt-validate`
This tool takes user-provided Devicetree(s) and either a schema directory
or a pre-processed schema file from `dt-mk-schema`, and then validates the
Devicetree against the schema.

Example:
```
dtc -O dtb -o device.dtb test/device.dts
dt-validate -s processed-schema.json device.dtb
```

`tools/dt-check-compatible`
This tool tests whether a list of compatible strings are found or not in
the schemas. By default, a compatible string is printed when it matches
one (or a pattern) in the schemas.

Example:
```
dt-check-compatible -s processed-schema.json vendor,a-compatible
```

## Installing
The project and its dependencies can be installed with pip:

```
pip3 install dtschema
```

or directly from git:

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema.git@main
```

All executables will be installed. Ensure ~/.local/bin is in the PATH.


For development, clone the git repository manually and run pip on local tree::

```
git clone https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema.git
cd dt-schema
pip3 install -e .
```

## Dependencies
Note: The above installation instructions handle all of the dependencies
automatically.

This code depends on Python 3 with the pylibfdt, ruamel.yaml, rfc3987, and jsonschema
libraries. Installing pylibfdt depends on the 'swig' program.

On Debian/Ubuntu, the dependencies can be installed with apt and/or pip. The
rfc3987 module is not packaged, so pip must be used:

```
sudo apt install swig
sudo apt install python3 python3-ruamel.yaml
pip3 install rfc3987
```


### jsonschema
This code depends on at least version 4.1.2 of the
[Python jsonschema](https://github.com/Julian/jsonschema/tree/master)
library for Draft 2019-09 support.

The module can be installed directly from github with pip:

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/Julian/jsonschema.git
```
