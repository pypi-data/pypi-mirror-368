      specification.

    description:
      Number of microseconds to wait before considering an I2C transfer has
      failed.

  i2c-scl-has-clk-low-timeout:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Indicates whether the controller implements the feature of wait
      induction through SCL low, with the timeout being implemented
      internally by the controller.

  i2c-sda-falling-time-ns:

      specification.

  i2c-analog-filter:

    type: boolean
    description:

  i2c-digital-filter-width-ns:
    description:

      (i2c-digital-filter). This width is specified in nanoseconds.

  i2c-analog-filter-cutoff-frequency:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      Frequency that the analog filter (i2c-analog-filter) uses to distinguish
      which signal to filter. Signal with higher frequency than specified will
      be filtered out. Only lower frequency will pass (this is applicable to a
      low-pass analog filter). Typical value should be above the normal i2c bus
      clock frequency (clock-frequency). Specified in Hz.

  interrupts:
    description:
      If not using interrupt-names, the first interrupt will be treated as the
      primary interrupt for the controller.

  interrupt-names:
    anyOf:
      - {} # Any name is allowed.
      - contains:
          enum:
            - smbus_alert
        description:
          Generic name is "smbus_alert" for the SMBusAlert signal. Other names
          are left to individual bindings.

  mctp-controller:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Indicates that the system is accessible via this bus as an endpoint for
      MCTP over I2C transport.

  multi-master:
    type: boolean
    description:
      States that there is another controller active on this bus. The OS can use
      this information to adapt power management to keep the arbitration awake
      all the time, for example. Can not be combined with 'single-master'.

  scl-gpios:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Specifies the GPIO related to SCL pin. Used for GPIO bus recovery.

  sda-gpios:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Specifies the GPIO related to SDA pin. Optional for GPIO bus recovery.

  single-master:
    type: boolean
    description:
      States that there is no other controller active on this bus. The OS can
      use this information to detect a stalled bus more reliably, for example.
      Can not be combined with 'multi-master'.

  smbalert-gpios:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Specifies the GPIO used for the SMBALERT# line. Optional.

  smbus:
    type: boolean
    description:
      States that additional SMBus restrictions and features apply to this bus.
      An example of feature is SMBusHostNotify. Examples of restrictions are
      more reserved addresses and timeout definitions.

  smbus-alert:
    type: boolean
    description:
      states that the optional SMBus-Alert feature apply to this bus.

        description: |
          One or many I2C target addresses. These are usually 7 bit addresses.
          However, flags can be attached to an address. I2C_TEN_BIT_ADDRESS is
          used to mark a 10 bit address. It is needed to avoid the ambiguity
          between e.g. a 7 bit address of 0x50 and a 10 bit address of 0x050
          which, in theory, can be on the same bus.
          Another flag is I2C_OWN_SLAVE_ADDRESS to mark addresses on which we
          listen to be devices ourselves.

      host-notify:
        type: boolean
        description:
          Device uses SMBus host notify protocol instead of interrupt line.
          Requires being connected to an adapter that supports this feature.

      interrupts:
        description:
          If not using interrupt-names, the first interrupt will be treated as
          the primary interrupt for the target.

      interrupt-names:
        anyOf:
          - {} # Any name is allowed.
          - contains:
              enum:
                - irq
                - wakeup
            description:
              Generic names are "irq" for the primary interrupt and "wakeup"
              for the wakeup interrupt. Other names are left to individual
              bindings.

      wakeup-source:
        description:
          Device can be used as a wakeup source. The device should also have
          "wakeup" interrupt for the device. If "wakeup" interrupt name is not
          present in the binding, then primary interrupt will be used as wakeup
          interrupt.
