properties:
  msi-parent:
    description: |
      A list of phandle + msi-specifier pairs, one for each MSI controller which the
      device is capable of using.

      This property is unordered, and MSIs may be allocated from any combination of
      MSI controllers listed in the msi-parent property.

      If a device has restrictions on the allocation of MSIs, these restrictions
      must be described with additional properties.

      When #msi-cells is non-zero, busses with an msi-parent will require
      additional properties to describe the relationship between devices on the bus
      and the set of MSIs they can potentially generate.
