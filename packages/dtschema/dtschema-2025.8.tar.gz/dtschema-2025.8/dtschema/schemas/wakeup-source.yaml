title: Wakeup sources

description: >
  Nodes that describe devices which have wakeup capability may contain a
  "wakeup-source" property. This property can be either boolean or a phandle
  array containing references to system idle states in which this device has a
  wakeup capability.

  If the device is marked as a wakeup-source, interrupt wake capability depends
  on the device specific "interrupt-names" property. If no interrupts are labeled
  as wake capable, then it is up to the device to determine which interrupts can
  wake the system.

  However if a device has a dedicated interrupt as the wakeup source, then it
  needs to specify/identify it using a device specific interrupt name. In such
  cases only that interrupt can be used as a wakeup interrupt.

  While various legacy interrupt names exist, new devices should use "wakeup" as
  the canonical interrupt name.
