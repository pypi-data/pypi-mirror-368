    An :class:`Expression` is a linear combination of
    functions values,
    inner products of points and / or gradients (product of 2 :class:`Point` objects),
    and constant scalar values.

    Attributes:
        name (str): A name set through the set_name method. None is no name is given.
        _is_leaf (bool): True if self is a function value defined from scratch
                                   (not as linear combination of other function values).
                                   False if self is a linear combination of existing :class:`Expression` objects.
        _value (float): numerical value of self obtained after solving the PEP via SDP solver.
                        Set to None before the call to the method `PEP.solve` from the :class:`PEP`.
        decomposition_dict (dict): decomposition of self as a linear combination of
                                   **leaf** :class:`Expression` objects.
                                   Keys are :class:`Expression` objects or tuple of 2 :class:`Point` objects.
                                   And values are their associated coefficients.
        counter (int): counts the number of **leaf** :class:`Expression` objects.

    :class:`Expression` objects can be added or subtracted together.
    They can also be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided by a scalar value.

    Example:
        >>> expr1 = Expression()
        >>> expr2 = Expression()
        >>> new_expr = (- expr1 + expr2 - 1) / 5

    :class:`Expression` objects can also be compared together

    Example:
        >>> expr1 = Expression()
        >>> expr2 = Expression()
        >>> inequality1 = expr1 <= expr2
        >>> inequality2 = expr1 >= expr2
        >>> equality = expr1 == expr2

    The three outputs `inequality1`, `inequality2` and `equality` are then :class:`Constraint` objects.
