def inexact_proximal_step(x0, f, gamma, opt='PD_gapII'):
    """
    This routine encodes an inexact proximal operation with step size :math:`\\gamma`. That is, it outputs a tuple
    :math:`(x, g\\in \\partial f(x), f(x), w, v\\in\\partial f(w), f(w), \\varepsilon)` which are described as follows.

    First, :math:`x` is an approximation to the proximal point of :math:`x_0` on function :math:`f`:

        .. math:: x \\approx \\mathrm{prox}_{\\gamma f}(x_0)\\triangleq\\arg\\min_x \\left\\{ \\gamma f(x) + \\frac{1}{2}\\|x-x_0\\|^2\\right\\},

    where the meaning of :math:`\\approx` depends on the option "opt" and is explained below. The notions of inaccuracy
    implemented within this routine are specified using primal and dual proximal problems, denoted by

        .. math::
            :nowrap:

            \\begin{eqnarray}
            &\\Phi^{(p)}_{\\gamma f}(x; x_0) \\triangleq \\gamma f(x) + \\frac{1}{2}\\|x-x_0\\|^2,\\\\
            &\\Phi^{(d)}_{\\gamma f}(v; x_0) \\triangleq -\\gamma f^*(v)-\\frac{1}{2}\\|x_0-\\gamma v\\|^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\|x_0\\|^2,\\\\
            \\end{eqnarray}

    where :math:`\\Phi^{(p)}_{\\gamma f}(x;x_0)` and :math:`\\Phi^{(d)}_{\\gamma f}(v;x_0)` respectively denote the primal
    and the dual proximal problems, and where :math:`f^*` is the Fenchel conjugate of :math:`f`. The options below
    encode different meanings of ":math:`\\approx`" by specifying accuracy requirements on primal-dual pairs:

        .. math:: (x,v) \\approx_{\\varepsilon} \\left(\\mathrm{prox}_{\\gamma f}(x_0),\\,\mathrm{prox}_{f^*/\\gamma}(x_0/\\gamma)\\right),

    where :math:`\\approx_{\\varepsilon}` corresponds to require the primal-dual pair :math:`(x,v)` to satisfy some
    primal-dual accuracy requirement:

        .. math:: \\Phi^{(p)}_{\\gamma f}(x;x_0)-\\Phi^{(d)}_{\\gamma f}(v;x_0) \\leqslant \\varepsilon,

    where :math:`\\varepsilon\\geqslant 0` is the error magnitude, which is returned to the user so that one can
    constrain it to be bounded by some other values.

    **Relation to the exact proximal operation:**  In the exact case (no error in the computation,
    :math:`\\varepsilon=0`), :math:`v` corresponds to the solution of the dual proximal problem and one can write

        .. math:: x = x_0-\\gamma g,

    with :math:`g=v=\mathrm{prox}_{f^*/\\gamma}(x_0/\\gamma)\\in\\partial f(x)`, and :math:`x=w`.

    **Reformulation of the primal-dual gap:** In regard with the exact proximal computation; the inexact case under
    consideration here can be described as performing

        .. math:: x = x_0-\\gamma v + e,

    where :math:`v` is an :math:`\\epsilon`-subgradient of :math:`f` at :math:`x`
    (notation :math:`v\\in\\partial_{\\epsilon} f(x)`)
    and :math:`e` is some additional computation error. Those elements allow for a common convenient reformulation of
    the primal-dual gap, written in terms of the magnitudes of :math:`\\epsilon` and of :math:`e`:

        .. math:: \\Phi^{(p)}_{\\gamma f}(x;x_0)-\\Phi^{(d)}_{\\gamma f}(v;x_0) = \\frac{1}{2} \|e\|^2 + \\gamma \\epsilon.

    **Options:** The following options are available (a list of such choices is presented in [4]; we provide a reference
    for each of those choices below).

        - 'PD_gapI' : the constraint imposed on the output is the vanilla (see, e.g., [2])

            .. math:: \\Phi^{(p)}_{\\gamma f}(x;x_0)-\\Phi^{(d)}_{\\gamma f}(v;x_0) \\leqslant \\varepsilon.

        This approximation requirement is used in one PEPit example: an accelerated inexact forward backward.

        - 'PD_gapII' : the constraint is stronger than the vanilla primal-dual gap, as more structure is imposed
                       (see, e.g., [1,5]) :

            .. math:: \\Phi^{(p)}_{\\gamma f}(x;x_0)-\\Phi^{(d)}_{\\gamma f}(g;x_0) \\leqslant \\varepsilon,

        where we imposed that :math:`v\\triangleq g\\in\\partial f(x)` and :math:`w\\triangleq x`. This approximation
        requirement is used in two PEPit examples: in a relatively inexact proximal point algorithm and in a partially
        inexact Douglas-Rachford splitting.

        - 'PD_gapIII' : the constraint is stronger than the vanilla primal-dual gap, as more structure is imposed
                        (see, e.g., [3]):

            .. math:: \\Phi^{(p)}_{\\gamma f}(x;x_0)-\\Phi^{(d)}_{\\gamma f}(\\tfrac{x_0 - x}{\\gamma};x_0) \\leqslant \\varepsilon,

        where we imposed that :math:`v \\triangleq \\frac{x_0 - x}{\\gamma}`.
