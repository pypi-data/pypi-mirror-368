class SmoothConvexLipschitzFunction(Function):
    """
    The :class:`SmoothConvexLipschitzFunction` class overwrites the `add_class_constraints` method of :class:`Function`,
    by implementing interpolation constraints of the class of smooth convex Lipschitz continuous functions.

    Attributes:
        L (float): smoothness parameter
        M (float): Lipschitz continuity parameter

    Smooth convex Lipschitz continuous functions are characterized by the smoothness parameters `L`
    and Lipschitz continuity parameter `M`, hence can be instantiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> from PEPit.functions import SmoothConvexLipschitzFunction
        >>> problem = PEP()
        >>> func = problem.declare_function(function_class=SmoothConvexLipschitzFunction, L=1., M=1.)
