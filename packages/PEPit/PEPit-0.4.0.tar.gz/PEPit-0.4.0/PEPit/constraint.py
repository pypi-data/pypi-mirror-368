class Constraint(object):
    """
    A :class:`Constraint` encodes either an equality or an inequality between two :class:`Expression` objects.

    A :class:`Constraint` must be understood either as
    `self.expression` = 0 or `self.expression` :math:`\\leqslant` 0
    depending on the value of `self.equality_or_inequality`.

    Attributes:
        name (str): A name set through the set_name method. None is no name is given.
        expression (Expression): The :class:`Expression` that is compared to 0.
        equality_or_inequality (str): "equality" or "inequality". Encodes the type of constraint.
        _value (float): numerical value of `self.expression` obtained after solving the PEP via SDP solver.
                        Set to None before the call to the method `PEP.solve` from the :class:`PEP`.
        _dual_variable_value (float): the associated dual variable from the numerical solution to the corresponding PEP.
                                      Set to None before the call to `PEP.solve` from the :class:`PEP`
        counter (int): counts the number of :class:`Constraint` objects.

    A :class:`Constraint` results from a comparison between two :class:`Expression` objects.

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import Expression
        >>> expr1 = Expression()
        >>> expr2 = Expression()
        >>> inequality1 = expr1 <= expr2
        >>> inequality2 = expr1 >= expr2
