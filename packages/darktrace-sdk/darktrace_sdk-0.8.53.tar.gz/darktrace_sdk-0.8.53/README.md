- **Fix: ensure host URL includes protocol (default to https if missing)**

---


## ‚ú® Features

- **Extensive API Coverage**: Most endpoints, parameters, and actions from the official Darktrace API Guide are implemented.
- **Modular & Maintainable**: Each endpoint group is a separate Python module/class.
- **Easy Authentication**: Secure HMAC-SHA1 signature generation and token management.
- **Async-Ready**: Designed for easy extension to async workflows.
- **Type Hints & Docstrings**: Full typing and documentation for all public methods.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation for every module and endpoint.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install darktrace-sdk
```

After installation, you'll import it in Python as `darktrace`:

```python
from darktrace import DarktraceClient
```

Or clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/darktrace.git
cd darktrace
pip install .
```

---

## üö¶ Quick Start

```python
from darktrace import DarktraceClient

# Initialize the client
client = DarktraceClient(
    host="https://your-darktrace-instance",
    public_token="YOUR_PUBLIC_TOKEN",
    private_token="YOUR_PRIVATE_TOKEN"
)

# Access endpoint groups
devices = client.devices
all_devices = devices.get()

antigena = client.antigena
actions = antigena.get_actions()

# Use Advanced Search with POST requests (Darktrace 6.1+)
advanced_search = client.advanced_search
query = {
    "search": "@type:\"ssl\" AND @fields.dest_port:\"443\"",
    "fields": [],
    "offset": 0,
    "timeframe": "3600"  # 1 hour
}
results = advanced_search.search(query=query, post_request=True)

print(all_devices)
print(actions)
print(results)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Endpoint Coverage

This SDK aims to cover **all endpoints** in the Darktrace API Guide, including:

- `/advancedsearch` (search, analyze, graph)
- `/aianalyst` (incidentevents, groups, acknowledge, pin, comments, stats, investigations, incidents)
- `/antigena` (actions, manual, summary)
- `/components`, `/cves`, `/details`, `/deviceinfo`, `/devices`, `/devicesearch`, `/devicesummary`
- `/endpointdetails`, `/enums`, `/filtertypes`, `/intelfeed`, `/mbcomments`, `/metricdata`, `/metrics`, `/models`, `/modelbreaches`, `/network`, `/pcaps`, `/similardevices`, `/status`, `/subnets`, `/summarystatistics`, `/tags`, and all `/agemail` endpoints


> **If you find a missing endpoint, open an issue or PR and it will be added!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### /devicesummary Endpoint Returns HTTP 500
The `/devicesummary` endpoint may return a `500 Internal Server Error` when accessed with API tokens, even though it works in the browser or with session/cookie authentication. This is a known limitation of the Darktrace API backend and not a bug in the SDK or your code.

**Workaround**: There is currently no programmatic workaround. If you require this endpoint, please contact Darktrace support or use browser-based access where possible.

**Status**: Tracked as [issue #37](https://github.com/LegendEvent/darktrace-sdk/issues/37). If you encounter this, please reference the issue for updates.
