TabEval is a comprehensive Python framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data generation methods. It provides a unified interface for benchmarking various synthetic data generation algorithms across multiple evaluation dimensions including density estimation, privacy preservation, machine learning efficacy, and structural fidelity.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics**: 50+ evaluation metrics across multiple dimensions
- **Flexible Benchmarking**: Easy-to-use benchmarking suite with caching and reproducibility features
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin-based design for easy integration of new methods and metrics

## üöÄ Quick Start

## üôè Acknowledgments

TabEval builds upon the work of many researchers and open-source projects in the synthetic data generation community. We thank all contributors and the broader research community for their valuable work. In particular, this project builds upon and extends the excellent work from [Synthcity](https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/synthcity). We acknowledge their foundational contributions to the synthetic data generation ecosystem and have adapted their framework to focus specifically on comprehensive evaluation methodologies.
