# Datoso Seed No-Intro

Datoso is a WIP Python command line tool to download and organize your Dat Roms.
As today the tool supports dat-omatic, redump, and translated-english dats.
It merges all the dats in a tree folder structure thought to use with Emulators rather than dats.
The dat file format must be compatible with [ROMVault](https://www.romvault.com/).

No-Intro is a collection of DATs aimed for video game preservation especialized in cartridge-based and digital systems.

## Installation

Datoso requires python 3.11+.

Install firefox and geckodriver, put geckodriver in your path.
[Tutorial](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/geckodriver-selenium-python)
