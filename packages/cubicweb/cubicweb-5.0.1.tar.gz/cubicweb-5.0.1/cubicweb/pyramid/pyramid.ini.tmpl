# How to use cubicweb.includes?
# This part allow to enable/disable some comportment included in CW.
# Sessions:
#   Uncomment "cubicweb.pyramid.session" if you want to use in base CubicWeb Session. You shouldn't
#   use this kind of sessions in production, use pyramid_session_redis instead
# Content negotiation:
#   By default, you have content negociation pyramid views  included
#   for all entities (if and only if the user have the read permission on these
#   entities); which mean you can request all entities with different content type
#   to have them in several RDF serialization and also in a simple HTML view.
#   If you use cubicweb_web, you may want to disable html default views,
#   since cubicweb_web provides better ones.
#   To disable html default views, comment "cubicweb.pyramid.rest_api.include_html". To
#   disable RDF default views, comment "cubicweb.pyramid.rest_api.include_rdf".
