Branches
========

We work on different branches during development depending on the changes we
make. The `default` branch receives commits intended to be published in the
next major version of CubicWeb. The releases branches (`4.x`, `5.x`, ..., `X.x`)
receive commits that don't include breaking changes, either new features or
bug-fixes.

The `default` branch is kept up-to-date by merging changes made on releases
branches into it regularly.

Releases
========

When releasing a new version of CubicWeb we use the `release-new` tool which
prepare an updated changelog and creates a tag. When the tag is pushed a CI
pipeline is triggered and if all the tests pass, the new version is released on
PyPI.
