# Governance

## Stewardship

The Civic Transparency specification is an experimental framework currently being developed and tested by Civic Interconnect.  
If it proves useful, it could benefit from stewardship by a neutral, multi-stakeholder group.  

Potential stewards might include:  
- Established standards bodies such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).  
- New or existing civic-technology consortiums.

## Roles

- **Spec Maintainers**: Curate schema and metric definitions; approve updates.  
- **Platform Implementers**: Explore adoption of the spec on their public endpoints.  
- **Auditors**: Test whether platform outputs conform to the spec.  
- **Community Advisors**: Offer feedback from journalism, civic, and research perspectives.

## Decision-Making & Feedback Channels

If the project reaches a stage where broader input is needed, the following channels could be used:

- **Technical Discussions**: Proposals and detailed discussions in GitHub Discussions and pull requests within the spec repository.  
- **Civic & Policy Input**: Broader community ideas and priorities shared through an open civic engagement platform (e.g., Decidim).  
- **Bridging**: Spec maintainers could summarize relevant civic discussions in GitHub for technical review, ensuring decision records remain traceable.

## Change Process

1. **Proposal**: Submitted as a pull request to the spec repository.  
2. **Review**: Maintainers and advisors review for technical, privacy, and neutrality concerns.  
3. **Approval**: Consensus among maintainers.  
4. **Versioning**: Released under semantic versioning.

## Transparency

- Public changelog of all schema and metric updates.  
- Open access to past versions.  
- Annual “conformance reports” could be published by implementers.

## Future Certification

If the framework gains adoption, platforms could optionally seek independent certification (similar to SOC 2) to signal compliance.
