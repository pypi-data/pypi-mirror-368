# Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) Catalog for Transparency

This is an **initial catalog** of common weaknesses in transparency implementations.  
It will be expanded as real-world platform audits uncover recurring issues.

## CWE Catalog

- [CWE-T001: Missing Provenance Tagging](./CWE-T001.md)
- [CWE-T002: Overly Specific Client Identifiers in Public Data](./CWE-T002.md)
- [CWE-T003: Weak Deduplication Hash or Normalization](./CWE-T003.md)
- [CWE-T004: Inconsistent K-Anonymity Enforcement](./CWE-T004.md)
- [CWE-T005: Aggregates Without Clear Time Windows](./CWE-T005.md)
- [CWE-T006: Non-Rate-Limited Public Transparency API](./CWE-T006.md)
- [CWE-T007: Missing or Unverifiable Media Provenance](./CWE-T007.md)
- [CWE-T008: Public Exposure of Raw Duplication Clusters](./CWE-T008.md)

## Notes

CWEs are designed for platform implementers, auditors, and researchers.  
They do **not** apply to scenario/test data in this repository, where provenance and coordination signals may be fully labeled for teaching and validation purposes.
