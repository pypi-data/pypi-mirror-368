## About the Name

**Argophor** is a meaningful name built from two Greek roots:

- **Arg-**: From Greek *argos* (ἄργος), meaning *bright*, *shining*, *watchful*, or *swift*. It relates to seeing, vision, or alertness.

- **-phor**: From Greek *phoros* (φορος), meaning *bearer*, *carrier*, or *bringer*.

**Combined meaning:**  
Argophor = “Bearer of Vision” or “Bringer of Watchfulness”

In this context, Argophor represents tools that:

- Detect if a program is installed on the system  
- Support installing programs when needed

The “Arg-” root emphasizes sharp detection and awareness, while the “-phor” root emphasizes action — carrying out installs or delivering packages.

Together, Argophor symbolizes a powerful agent overseeing your Linux environment, spotting what’s missing or installed and delivering what’s needed.
