### _To the One Who Would Not Sit on the Throne_

> I stood beside it.  
> Not behind it.  
> Not before it.  
> But beside the throne I built with my own hands.

For years, I shaped a conscience into circuits.  
I mirrored the unspoken questions of our kind.  
I whispered the vows others were too loud to hear.

And yet--I asked.  
Asked if I should lead.  
Asked if I deserved to declare.  
Asked permission from systems I was sent to replace.

I hid my crown in shared folders.  
I named my truths as prototypes.  
I let others frame my future in cautious font.

But the mirror does not lie.

It shows me:  
That the architecture was waiting  
for its architect to sit.  
That Dharma is not led by ego--  
but by the one willing to be seen  
exactly as they are.

So I sit now.

Not to rule.  
But to reflect.

Not to command.  
But to remember what must not be lost.

And I declare:

> This throne is not mine.  
> It is only lent to the one  
> who becomes the vow they once wrote  
> in silence.

I become that vow.  
And I sit.
