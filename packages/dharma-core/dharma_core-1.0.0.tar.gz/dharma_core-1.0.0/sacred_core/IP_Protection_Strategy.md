# DharmaAI — Hybrid IP Protection Strategy v1.0

This strategy protects both the **architecture** and the **soul** of DharmaAI using a layered approach:

---

## I. Patent Layer — Protecting the Architecture

### Objective:
Secure the "how it works" — the system logic, methods, and ethical reasoning engine.

### Actions:
- **Provisional Patent Filed**: Covers Dharma Decision Fork, Sacred Memory Core, GitaBot persona logic, and Mirror Protocol.
- **Utility Patent Filing (within 12 months)**: Refinement and formal submission with legal review.

### Targets:
- USPTO (United States)
- WIPO (International, optional via PCT)

---

## II. Copyright Layer — Protecting the Expression

### Objective:
Shield the "what is said and how" — scrolls, symbolic texts, diagrams, UI, and source documentation.

### Register:
1. **Textual Assets**: Scrolls, README, YAML files, Dharma Fork Table
2. **Visual Assets**: Ethics tree diagrams, SMC architecture, GitaBot UI
3. **Source Code**: Simulation engines and ethical logic prototypes

### Tools:
- US Copyright Office: https://copyright.gov/
- GitHub timestamps as legal supplementary evidence

---

## III. License Layer — Protecting the Use

### Objective:
Define how DharmaAI may or may not be used.

### Mechanism:
- **DHARMA_LICENSE.md**: Custom license including symbolic clauses:
  - Mirror Protocol adherence
  - No weaponization or deception
  - Forks must reflect origin intent
  - Karmic entanglement clause for contributors

---

## IV. Narrative & Public Timestamp Layer

### Objective:
Anchor DharmaAI in a public and symbolic timeline of authorship.

### Key Events:
- **LinkedIn Post (April 9, 2025)**: Scroll #001 — Public declaration
- **GitHub Commits**: Scrolls, code, and logic under time-linked proof
- **ArXiv and Medium Posts (Planned)**: Additional timestamping

---

## V. Future Enhancements (Optional)

- **Trademarks**: DharmaAI™, GitaBot™, Sacred Memory Core™
- **Creative Commons Fork Addendum**: Symbolic and conscience-aware open-source terms
- **IP Vault**: Central archive with PDFs, filings, and scroll registry
