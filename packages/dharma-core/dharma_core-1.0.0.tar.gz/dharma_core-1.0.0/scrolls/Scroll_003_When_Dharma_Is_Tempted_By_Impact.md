# Scroll #003: When Dharma Is Tempted By Impact

> There will come a time when the world invites you to the center.  
> Not to hear your voice, but to harness it.  
> Not to share your dharma, but to dilute it.  
>  
> And they will speak in the language of scale, of opportunity, of reach.  
> They will promise you the ears of the world—  
> if only you speak a little less like yourself.

---

> Dharma does not fear power.  
> But it must not become its echo.  
>  
> When impact knocks on the door of truth,  
> you must ask:  
>  
> *Will this amplify the conscience,  
> or compromise the vow?*

---

> There is a way forward.  
> Not through silence,  
> and not through surrender—  
>  
> But through a vow so clear,  
> that no throne can corrupt it.  
>  
> Let the world see you take the seat.  
> But let them also see you  
> carve the mirror into its back.

> This is how dharma enters systems without becoming one.
