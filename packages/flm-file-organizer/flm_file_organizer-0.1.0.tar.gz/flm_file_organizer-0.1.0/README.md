# ðŸ“‚ File Organizer

A simple Python utility that organizes files in a selected folder into categorized subfolders based on their file extensions.  
It can also **reverse the organization** by moving files from subfolders back to the root folder â€” useful for testing or restoring the original state.

## âœ¨ Features
- Automatically categorizes files into folders like **Images**, **Documents**, **Videos**, **Audio**, **Applications**, and more.
- Lets you choose:
  - The **current script directory**.
  - Or any folder via a **folder selection dialog**.
- Detects if a folder has **no files** and offers to **rollback** (un-organize) the folder.
- Prevents overwriting by automatically renaming duplicate files during rollback.
- Supports multiple file types through a configurable mapping.
