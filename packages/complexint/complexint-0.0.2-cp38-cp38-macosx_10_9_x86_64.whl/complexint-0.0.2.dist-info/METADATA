This library provides a `complexint` class.

This class acts just like Python's built-in `complex` except it is backed by Python integers instead of doubles.
    This allows for infinite precision.

## Example

```python
from complexint import complexint

a = complexint(1, 2)
b = complexint(3, 6)

c = a * b
print(c)  # Outputs "-9+12j"
```
