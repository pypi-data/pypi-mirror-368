#### casm-project

The casm-project package makes it easier to construct, fit, and use a cluster expansion in CASM version >= 2 by:

- providing quick access to the most commonly used methods,
- automatically reading project data needed by those methods from a CASM project directory,
- automatically writing the results to the standard location in a CASM project directory.

Using casm-project to store project data in standard locations makes it easier to understand what was done and share the project with others.
