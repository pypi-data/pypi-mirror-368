#### casm-project

The casm-project package makes it easier to construct, fit, and use a cluster expansion in CASM version >= 2 by:

- providing quick access to the most commonly used methods,
- automatically reading project data needed by those methods from a CASM project directory,
- automatically writing the results to the standard location in a CASM project directory.

Using casm-project to store project data in standard locations makes it easier to understand what was done and share the project with others. 


#### Install

    pip install casm-project


#### Usage

See the [casm docs](https://prisms-center.github.io/CASMcode_pydocs/casm/overview/latest/).


#### About CASM

The casm-project package is part of the [CASM](https://prisms-center.github.io/CASMcode_docs/) open source software package, which is designed to perform first-principles statistical mechanical studies of multi-component crystalline solids.

CASM is developed by the Van der Ven group, originally at the University of Michigan and currently at the University of California Santa Barbara.
