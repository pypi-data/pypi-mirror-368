## Developer information

### Git LFS

The data in the testdata directory is stored with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/).
Make sure `git-lfs` is installed and that you have run the command `git lfs install`
at least once. You only need to run this once per user account.

### Dependencies

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used for dependency management. Install
poetry and run the command below from the root directory to install the dependencies.

```shell
poetry install -E test --no-root
```

### Tests

Use the following command from the root directory to run the tests:

```shell
poetry run pytest  # from root directory
```

For VS Code there are extensions for opening a python script as Jupyter Notebook,
for example:
[Jupytext for Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.vscode-jupytext).

### Code quality

Run 'ruff' on all files with safe fixes:

```shell
poetry run ruff check --fix .
```

### Formatting

Format the code with `black` and `isort` by running the following command from the
root directory:

```shell
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .
```

### Pre-commit hooks

We are using [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to make sure the code is
correctly formatted and consistent before committing. Use the following command from
the root directory in the repo to install the pre-commit hooks:

```shell
poetry run pre-commit install
```

It then checks the changed files before committing. You can run the pre-commit checks
on all files by using this command:

```shell
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Documentation

To generate the API-documentation locally, run the following command from the root
directory:

```shell
poetry run sphinx-build -W docs docs/_build
```

Then open the file `docs/_build/index.html`.

To check and run the docstrings examples, run this command:

```shell
poetry run xdoctest --command=all ./src/sgis
```
