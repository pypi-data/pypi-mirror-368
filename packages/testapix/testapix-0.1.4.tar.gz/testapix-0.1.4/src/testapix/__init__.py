r"""TestAPIX - Comprehensive Python API Testing Framework.

TestAPIX provides everything you need to build robust, maintainable API tests.
This package follows the principle of "convention over configuration" while
remaining flexible for advanced use cases.

Basic usage:
    from testapix import APIClient, assert_that

    # Async client (recommended)
    async with APIClient(base_url="https://api.example.com") as client:
        response = await client.get("/users")
        assert_that(response).has_status(200).has_json_path("users")

    # Sync client for simpler cases
    with SyncAPIClient(base_url="https://api.example.com") as client:
        response = client.get("/users")
        assert_that(response).has_status(200)
