A single, beginner-friendly Python layer that wraps the most common introductory quantum tasks so newcomers can learn and build quickly.

## Key Features

-   ðŸš€ **One-Line Demos**: Run classic quantum algorithms like Bell's state, Grover's search, and Teleportation with a single function call.
-   ðŸ”¬ **Intuitive Noise Simulation**: Easily compare ideal results with noisy ones to build an intuition for the challenges of real hardware.
-   ðŸ“Š **Visual, Explain-First Outputs**: Get beautiful plots and plain-language explanations of "what just happened" with every run.
-   ðŸ”„ **Framework-Agnostic**: Start with Qiskit's simulator by default, and switch to Google's Cirq with a single parameter.

## Quick Start

### Installation
Requires Python 3.10 or newer. Install with `uv`:
uv add quantum-starter-lab

### Example Usage
Create and visualize a Bell state with a bit of noise in just a few lines of Python:
from quantum_starter_lab.api import make_bell

Run a Bell state demo with 1% bit-flip noise
results = make_bell(noise_name="bit_flip", p=0.01, seed=42)

Print the simple explanation and counts
print(results)

Show the circuit diagram and histogram plot
results.plot()
