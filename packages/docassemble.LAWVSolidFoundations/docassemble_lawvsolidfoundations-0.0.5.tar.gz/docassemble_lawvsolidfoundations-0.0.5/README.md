LAWV Solid Foundations is a project supported by the Pro Bono unit at Legal Aid of West Virginia aimed at providing clients in need a guardianship or adoption with some pleadings and paperwork for court and their estate. The interview is intended to be conducted in a clinic-like setting working with an attorney rather than a fully self-guided process.  The code is an amalgamation of the LAWV Kinship Connector and the LAWV Will Clinic interviews.
