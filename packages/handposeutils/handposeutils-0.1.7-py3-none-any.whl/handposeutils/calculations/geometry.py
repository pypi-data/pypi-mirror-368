    Calculate the total 3D length of a finger.

    Highkey, this information is pretty arbitrary, since unless you normalize scaling, absolute distances aren't

    The length is computed by summing the Euclidean distances between
    each pair of adjacent joints for the given finger.

    ----------
    finger_name : str
