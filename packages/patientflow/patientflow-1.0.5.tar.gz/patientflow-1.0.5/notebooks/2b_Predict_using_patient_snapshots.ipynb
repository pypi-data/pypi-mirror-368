A more robust approach for testing models intended for prospective use is to apply temporal splits, where you train on earlier data and validate/test on later data, mimicking how the model would be deployed in a real-world setting. I show the application of temporal splits here.\n",

I defined a series of prediction times, and then sampled finished visits to get snapshots that represent those visits while still in progress. When you follow this method, you may end up with multiple snapshots per patient visit. Is this OK, for your analysis? You will need to decide whether you include all snapshots from a single visit into the training, validation or testing of a predictive model. Snapshots from the same visit are inherently correlated, which may violate assumptions of the statistical or machine learning methods you are using. For this reason, we chose to sample only one snapshot per patient visit. \n",
