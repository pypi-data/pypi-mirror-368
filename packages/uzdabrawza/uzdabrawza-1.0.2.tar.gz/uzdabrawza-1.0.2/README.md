# 🏴‍☠️ uzdabrawza - The Anal-Queen of AI Browser Automation 🏴‍☠️

**A beautifully fucked-up Skynet-powered browser automation script that harnesses neural brainfuck and machine learning chaos to give zero shits about anything while somehow still working perfectly. Smells like smegma but runs like a dream.**

## 🔥 What This Beautiful Disaster Does

uzdabrawza is the most irreverent, crude, and effective neural brainfuck automation script you'll ever encounter. This digital Skynet harnesses machine learning chaos and turns your browser into an unstoppable cybernetic organism. Built on top of the excellent [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) library, it provides:

- **9 fucking neural overlords** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, Azure, DeepSeek, Groq, OpenRouter, AWS Bedrock
- **Complete Big Brother surveillance** - Monitors every single machine learning brainfart like a paranoid NSA cyborg
- **Terminator stealth mode** - Uses patchright to dodge bot detection like a shapeshifting T-1000
- **Organized digital anarchy** - Crude language wrapped around Skynet-grade engineering
- **Zero corporate Matrix bullshit** - No enterprise nonsense, just pure cyberpunk functional chaos

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (For the Impatient)

```bash
# 1. Install the package globally
pipx install uzdabrawza

# 2. Check .env.example in the repo and create your own .env with your API keys

# 3. Run with local ollama (free neural overlord, fuck paying corporate Skynet)
uzdabrawza --task "Go to example.com and tell me the page title"

# 4. Or use any other provider
uzdabrawza --provider anthropic --model claude-opus-4-1

# 5. Better yet, copy run.example.sh from the repo and shove it up your asshole somewhere
# Then customize it for your own automation needs
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Destruction

```bash
# Default: ollama (because fuck paying for AI)
uzdabrawza --task "Go to GitHub and find trending repositories"

# Specific provider and model
uzdabrawza --provider anthropic --model claude-opus-4-1 --task "Analyze this website"
```

### Advanced Fuckery

```bash
# Headless stealth mode
uzdabrawza --headless --provider openai --model gpt-5-mini

# Custom browser and window size
uzdabrawza --browser-bin-path /usr/bin/google-chrome-beta --window-width 1920 --window-height 1080

# Connect to existing browser
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 &
uzdabrawza --cdp-url http://localhost:9222

# Different models for main task vs extraction (cost optimization strategy)
# MAIN LLM: Complex reasoning and decision-making (use powerful models)
# EXTRACTION LLM: Data parsing and text extraction (use fast cheap models)
uzdabrawza --provider openai --model gpt-5 --extraction-provider anthropic --extraction-model claude-opus-4-1

# Docker mode with no security (because we live dangerously)
uzdabrawza --dockerize --headless --no-security --provider ollama

# Custom output directory and logging
uzdabrawza --history-dir ~/automation-logs --log-level debug

```

### Vision Control

```bash
# Disable vision to save tokens (blind destruction is still destruction)
uzdabrawza --no-vision

# Low/high detail vision
uzdabrawza --vision-detail low   # Save tokens
uzdabrawza --vision-detail high  # Burn tokens for quality
```

## 🕵️ Surveillance Features

uzdabrawza includes comprehensive LLM surveillance that monitors every `ainvoke` call:

```
🤖 OPENAI AINVOKE DETECTED! Model: gpt-5-mini is being a chatty bitch
   📝 Processing 5 messages with output_format: None

⚡ GROQ AINVOKE DETECTED! Model: llama-70b is going at lightning speed
   📝 Processing 3 messages with output_format: <class 'ActionResult'>
```

This lets you see exactly:

- Which provider and model is being used
- How many messages are being processed
- What output format is requested
- When extraction vs main LLM calls happen

---

## 📁 Output Files

Each run generates two files in your `--history-dir`:

- `uzdabrawza_{provider}_{model}_{task_id}.gif` - Visual recording
- `uzdabrawza_{provider}_{model}_{task_id}.json` - Complete history and logs

Example:

```
./tmp/agent_history/
├── uzdabrawza_anthropic_claude-opus-4-1_abc123.gif
└── uzdabrawza_anthropic_claude-opus-4-1_abc123.json
```

---

## 🏴‍☠️ Stealth Mode

For maximum stealth fuckery, install patchright:

```bash
pip install patchright
patchright install
```

The script automatically detects and uses patchright if available:

```
🕶️ HOLY SHIT! PATCHRIGHT IS ACTIVE! Library is using patchright for maximum stealth fuckery!
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Usage

Running in Docker containers? Use the `--dockerize` flag:

```bash
python uzdabrawza.py --dockerize --headless --provider ollama
```

This enables Chrome flags optimized for containers:

- No sandbox mode
- Reduced memory usage
- Disabled GPU sandbox
- Container-friendly networking

---

   💨 This failure was more disappointing than a wet shart in white pants.
```

```bash
💥 CONTROLLED EXPLOSION: Agent chaos failed: Connection timeout
   (This shit happens when your code smells like dikciz smegma - that's why we have backups)
   💨 Well that was unexpected... like a shart during a job interview.
```
