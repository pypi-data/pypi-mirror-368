## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🎤 Voice-Controlled Usage (Recommended)

```python
from jarvis import Shaheen_Jarvis

# Initialize with voice enabled
jarvis = Shaheen_Jarvis(enable_voice=True)

# Start interactive voice session
while True:
    command = jarvis.listen()  # Listen for voice input
    if command:
        response = jarvis.dispatch(command)  # Process command
        print(f"Jarvis: {response}")
        jarvis.speak(response)  # Speak the response
```

### 💻 CLI Usage

```bash
