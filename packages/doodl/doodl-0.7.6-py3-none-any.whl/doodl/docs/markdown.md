# Writing Markdown

Doodl uses [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) internally to turn
Markdown into HTML, which it then processes to do its magic.  This
means that anything that is valid in Pandoc as an HTML generator is
valid in doodl.

Doodl adds two kinds of special tags to Markdown/HTML.  First
there's the `<sidenote>` tag. Anything enclosed in these tags will
generate a numbered side note in the wide margin as close as possible
to the note number in the main text. Here's an example of one:

```html
<sidenote>
I'm a side note! Use me for commentary, links, bits of
maths, anything that's peripheral to the main discussion.
</sidenote>.
```

You can easily add images to the side notes and margin notes just by
including the usual markdown syntax for inserting an
image.<sup>1</sup><span class="marginnote">1. The syntax is `![alt text](filename)`
</span>
within the tags.

Then there is a `<marginnote>` tag which is the nearly the same as the
side note, only there's no number linking it to a particular part in
the main text. You'll see to the right an example of a margin note
containing a d3 donut chart.<span class="marginnote">
An example of margin note containing a donut plot. Because a tooltip
is available we can create a less cluttered chart with labels for the
smaller segments demoted to the tooltip.
<span  class="chart-container" id="piechart_0"></span>
</span>

Including d3 charts in a doodl document is very easy. The only this
required a source of data, the format of which depends on the type of
chart. For example this chart was generated using:

```html
<piechart
    data='[
      {"label": "Apples", "value": 10},
      {"label": "Bananas", "value": 20},
      {"label": "Cherries", "value": 15},
      {"label": "Grapes", "value": 25}
    ]'
    donut=1
>
</piechart>
```

An alternative for this and all charts is to option the data from a
file, like this:

```html
<piechart
    path="data/fruit.json"
    format="json"
    donut=1
>
</piechart>
```

where `fruit.json` contains:

~~~json
[
  {"label": "Apples", "value": 10},
  {"label": "Bananas", "value": 20},
  {"label": "Cherries", "value": 15},
  {"label": "Grapes", "value": 25}
]
~~~

The standard arguments are described in the [charts section](/charts/).
Chart-specific arguments (as well as the data required by each chart
type) are described in the writeups for each chart.

<script>
 setTimeout(() => {
  Promise.resolve().then(() => 
  Doodl.piechart(
    '#piechart_0',
    [
      {'label': 'Apples', 'value': 10},
      {'label': 'Bananas', 'value': 20},
      {'label': 'Cherries', 'value': 15},
      {'label': 'Grapes', 'value': 25}
    ], {
      'width': 200,
      'height': 200
    },{},[
      '#A1C9F4', '#FFB482', '#8DE5A1', '#FF9F9B', '#D0BBFF',
      '#DEBB9B', '#FAB0E4', '#CFCFCF', '#FFFEA3', '#B9F2F0'
    ], 1
  ));
}, 1000);
</script>
