# LayerZero

**LayerZero** is a modular PyTorch training framework designed to simplify deep learning experiments.  
It includes:
- A **highly configurable Trainer class** for managing training loops, validation, and callbacks.
- An **ImageDataLoader** with an advanced augmentation pipeline.
- A **Helper utility** for tracking metrics and plotting training/validation loss curves.
- Support for custom metrics and model checkpointing.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

### 1. **Trainer**
- Clean and modular training loop â€” no boilerplate needed.
- Tracks **loss and custom metrics** during training and validation.
- Supports **callbacks** such as model checkpoint saving.
- Works with **any PyTorch model** and dataset.
- Logs progress with clear and formatted output.
- Easy integration with the `Helper` class for metric visualization.

---

### 2. **ImageDataLoader**
A robust, class-based image loading pipeline that:
- Uses **Torchvision datasets** (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST, ImageNet).
- Applies **state-of-the-art augmentations**:
  - Random horizontal flips
  - Random rotations
  - Random resized crops
  - Color jitter
  - (Optional) **TrivialAugmentWide** for stronger generalization
- Normalizes images using dataset-specific mean and standard deviation.
- Returns **ready-to-use DataLoader** objects for both training and testing.

---

### 3. **Helper**
- Tracks training and validation metrics (loss, accuracy, etc.).
- Can plot **loss curves** after training:
  - Training loss over epochs
  - Validation loss over epochs
- Saves plots automatically for experiment tracking.
