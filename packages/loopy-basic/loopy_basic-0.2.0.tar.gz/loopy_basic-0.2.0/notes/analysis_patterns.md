# Analysis Patterns Documentation

This document outlines the key analysis patterns and approaches used in the Loopy Basic project for Type 1 diabetes data analysis.

## CGM-Focused Time-Series Analysis

The primary focus of this project is on Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) data analysis to identify patterns and trends for optimizing diabetes management.

### Time-Scale Analysis

- **Focus on manageable time periods**: Analyze weeks or months of data rather than viewing all 243K+ readings at once
- **Temporal patterns**: Identify patterns at specific times of day or days of the week
- **Trend identification**: Discover trends that can help optimize diabetes management

### Analysis Workflow

1. **Exploratory analysis**: Use marimo notebooks for interactive data exploration
2. **Pattern discovery**: Identify recurring patterns in glucose levels
3. **Statistical analysis**: Calculate metrics for specific time periods
4. **Treatment correlation**: (Future goal) Correlate CGM data with treatment settings

## Key Analysis Approaches

### Time-of-Day Patterns

- Hourly glucose trends
- Meal-time response patterns
- Overnight glucose stability

### Day-of-Week Patterns

- Weekday vs. weekend differences
- Activity-related patterns

### Statistical Summaries

- Average glucose by time period
- Time in range metrics
- Variability measures
- Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia frequency

## Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data retrieval**: Query specific time ranges from MongoDB
2. **Data cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers
3. **Conversion to pandas**: Transform MongoDB documents to pandas DataFrames with PyArrow backend
4. **Time-series preparation**: Process timestamps and prepare for time-series analysis
5. **Visualization**: Generate plots and charts for pattern identification
6. **Statistical analysis**: Calculate metrics and identify significant patterns

## Visualization Approaches

- Time-series plots for trend visualization
- Heatmaps for time-of-day patterns
- Box plots for variability analysis
- Histograms for distribution analysis

## Future Analysis Goals

- Correlation between CGM data and insulin dosing
- Meal response pattern identification
- Exercise impact analysis
- Sleep quality correlation
