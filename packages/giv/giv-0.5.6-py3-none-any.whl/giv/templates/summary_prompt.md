   - Group related items together and maintain logical order.
   - Do not include groups with no related items.
   - Each list item should provide enough detail to understand the change.

4. Processing Instructions  
   - Review the provided change summaries.  
   - Assign changes to the appropriate group above.  
   - Extract file paths or components when pertinent.  
   - If possible, explain "what" changed, "why," and the "impact."
   - Only use information provided in this content in your response.
   - Consolidate related changes from different summaries to avoid duplicating information.
   - Determine if older changes have been superseded and use only the latest information.
