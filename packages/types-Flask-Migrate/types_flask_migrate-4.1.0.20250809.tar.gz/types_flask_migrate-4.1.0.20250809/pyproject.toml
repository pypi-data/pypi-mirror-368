## Typing stubs for Flask-Migrate

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/) type stub package for
the [`Flask-Migrate`](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-Migrate) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `Flask-Migrate`. This version of
`types-Flask-Migrate` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`Flask-Migrate==4.1.*`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/Flask-Migrate`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/Flask-Migrate)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.16.1
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.403

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`91ba0da4aad754c912a82b9e052cb4f8191ce520`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/91ba0da4aad754c912a82b9e052cb4f8191ce520).
