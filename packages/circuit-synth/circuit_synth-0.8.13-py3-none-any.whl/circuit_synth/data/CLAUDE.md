### KiCad Component Search
```bash
# Primary slash commands for finding KiCad components
# /find-symbol STM32 - Search for STM32 symbols
# /find-footprint LQFP - Search for LQFP footprints

# Development slash commands (for contributors)
# /dev-run-tests - Run comprehensive test suite
# /dev-update-and-commit "description" - Update docs and commit changes

# Manual search in KiCad libraries (if needed)
find /usr/share/kicad/symbols -name "*.kicad_sym" | xargs grep -l "STM32"
find /usr/share/kicad/footprints -name "*.kicad_mod" | grep -i lqfp
```

## Code Style Guidelines

**IMPORTANT: Follow these conventions exactly**
- Use modern Python with type hints and dataclasses
- NO inheritance complexity or global state management
- Follow SOLID, KISS, YAGNI, and DRY principles
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Write comprehensive docstrings for public APIs

## Workflow Preferences

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) - MANDATORY APPROACH:**
1. **Write tests first** based on expected input/output behavior
2. **Run tests to confirm they fail** (red phase)
3. **Write minimal code** to make tests pass (green phase)
4. **Refactor and improve** while keeping tests passing
5. **Test thoroughly at each step** - don't assume code works
6. **YOU MUST run linting and type checking** before committing

**Incremental Development Philosophy:**
- **Make slow, steady progress** - small incremental changes are better than large jumps
- **Test every assumption** - don't assume your code does what you think it does
- **Validate behavior continuously** - run tests after every small change
- **Confirm expectations** - manually verify outputs match what you expect
- **One feature at a time** - complete and thoroughly test one feature before moving to the next
- **Example workflow**: Write test → Run test (fails) → Write minimal code → Run test (passes) → Manually verify output → Move to next small piece

**Planning Before Coding:**
- Always ask Claude to make a plan before implementing
- Use "think" keywords for extended thinking mode
- Break complex tasks into smaller, actionable steps

## STM32 Peripheral Search Pattern (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**CRITICAL: Detect and handle STM32 peripheral queries directly - DO NOT use agents**

When user asks questions like:
- "find stm32 mcu that has 3 spi's and is available on jlcpcb"
- "stm32 with 2 uarts available on jlc" 
- "find stm32 with usb and 4 timers in stock"

**Use direct implementation immediately:**

```python
from src.circuit_synth.ai_integration.stm32_search_helper import handle_stm32_peripheral_query

# Check if this is an STM32 peripheral query first
response = handle_stm32_peripheral_query(user_query)
if response:
    return response  # Direct answer - no agents, no web search, no complex workflow
```

**Detection Pattern:**
- Contains: stm32 + peripheral (spi/uart/i2c/usb/can/adc/timer/gpio) + availability (jlcpcb/jlc/stock)
- This workflow gives answers in 30 seconds vs 4+ minutes with agents

**Why this matters:**
- We have precise STM32 pin data via modm-devices
- JLCPCB caching prevents repeated API calls
- KiCad symbol verification ensures working results
- User gets exactly what they asked for quickly

**Debugging Strategy:**
- **Add extensive logging during development**: Use Python's `logging` module liberally when troubleshooting or implementing new features
- **Log key data points**: Component creation, net connections, file operations, API calls
- **Remove non-essential logs when feature is complete**: Keep only critical error logs and high-level status messages
- **Example**: `logging.debug(f"Creating component {ref} with symbol {symbol}")` during development, remove when stable

**Multi-Attempt Problem Solving Protocol:**
When you have attempted to fix the same issue 3+ times without success, **STOP** and follow this systematic approach:

1. **Document the Problem State**:
   - Write a clear problem statement
   - List all attempted solutions with outcomes
   - Identify recurring patterns in failures
   - Note any error messages, symptoms, or clues

2. **Context Management**:
   - Use `/compact` to compress the conversation context
   - Save important findings to `memory-bank/issues/` if needed
   - Clear mental context to approach fresh

3. **Deep Analysis Phase**:
   - Break the problem into smaller, isolated components
   - Identify root causes vs. symptoms
   - Question initial assumptions about the problem
   - Consider alternative approaches or architectures

4. **Research Phase**:
   - Use WebSearch to research similar problems, error messages, or techniques
   - Look for official documentation, Stack Overflow solutions, GitHub issues
   - Research best practices for the specific technology or domain
   - Investigate whether the approach itself is fundamentally flawed

5. **Systematic Solution**:
   - Based on research, create a new approach plan
   - Test each component in isolation
   - Implement incrementally with verification at each step
   - Document the successful solution for future reference

**Example trigger scenarios:**
- Same CI test failing after 3+ different fix attempts
- Repeatedly encountering the same error with different "solutions"
- Multiple approaches to the same feature all hitting similar roadblocks
- Environment or dependency issues that persist across multiple fixes

## Memory Bank System

**CRITICAL: Use memory-bank/ effectively for context preservation**

The `memory-bank/` directory maintains project context and technical knowledge across sessions. Use it strategically:

### Memory Bank Structure
```
memory-bank/
├── progress/          # Development progress tracking
├── decisions/         # Technical decisions and rationale  
├── patterns/          # Reusable code patterns and solutions
├── issues/           # Known issues and workarounds
└── knowledge/        # Domain-specific insights and learnings
```

### How to Use Memory Bank

**1. Progress Tracking (`memory-bank/progress/`):**
- Create focused entries for significant technical milestones
- Document **what** was implemented and **why** it was needed
- Keep entries concise (2-3 sentences maximum)
- Use date-based filenames: `2025-07-28-feature-name.md`

**2. Technical Decisions (`memory-bank/decisions/`):**
- Record architectural choices and trade-offs
- Document **why** you chose one approach over alternatives
- Include context about constraints and requirements

**3. Reusable Patterns (`memory-bank/patterns/`):**
- Save common circuit-synth code patterns
- Document successful component configurations
- Record KiCad symbol/footprint mappings that work well

**4. Issue Tracking (`memory-bank/issues/`):**
- Document known bugs with workarounds
- Track compatibility issues between tools
- Record debugging strategies that worked

**Example Memory Bank Entry:**
```markdown
# KiCad Symbol Search Optimization

## Summary
Implemented cross-platform KiCad library search with fallback paths for macOS and Linux.

## Key Changes
- Added `/find-symbol` command with grep-based search across multiple library paths
- Handles both standard KiCad installations and Homebrew locations on macOS

## Impact
Users can now reliably find KiCad symbols regardless of installation method.
```

## Agent Workflow

**CRITICAL: Use specialized agents for optimal results**

This repository uses a structured agent workflow. Always start with **orchestrator** for complex multi-step tasks.

### Available Agents and Their Expertise

1. **orchestrator** - Master coordinator for complex projects
   - **When to use**: Multi-step tasks spanning different domains
   - **Capabilities**: Breaks down complex requests, delegates to specialists, manages dependencies
   - **Example**: "Build a complete ESP32 development board with power management"

2. **architect** - Planning and requirements analysis
   - **When to use**: Unclear requirements, need structured planning
   - **Capabilities**: Requirement gathering, task breakdown, technical planning
   - **Example**: "Plan the implementation of a new PCB routing algorithm"

3. **code** - Software engineering best practices
   - **When to use**: Code implementation, refactoring, code reviews
   - **Capabilities**: SOLID principles, design patterns, code quality
   - **Example**: "Refactor the component creation system for better maintainability"

4. **circuit-synth** - Circuit design and KiCad integration specialist
   - **When to use**: Circuit design, component selection, KiCad workflows
   - **Capabilities**: Uses `/find-symbol` and `/find-footprint`, circuit topology expertise
   - **Example**: "Design a USB-C power delivery circuit with proper protection"

5. **general-purpose** - Research and complex searches
   - **When to use**: Open-ended research, file searching across large codebases
   - **Capabilities**: Multi-round searching, code analysis, documentation research
   - **Example**: "Find all references to voltage regulator implementations in the codebase"

### Agent Usage Strategy

**Start Right:**
```bash
# Complex multi-domain task
Task(subagent_type="orchestrator", description="Build ESP32 board", prompt="Design complete ESP32 development board with USB-C, power management, and programming interface")

# Planning unclear requirements  
Task(subagent_type="architect", description="Plan PCB algorithm", prompt="Analyze requirements and create implementation plan for new PCB component placement algorithm")

# Circuit-specific design work
Task(subagent_type="circuit-synth", description="Design power circuit", prompt="Create 3.3V/5V dual rail power supply circuit with USB-C input and protection")
```

**Let Orchestrator Coordinate:**
- Don't manually chain agents - let orchestrator manage the workflow
- Orchestrator will delegate to architect → circuit-synth → code as needed
- Trust the orchestrator to choose the right specialist for each subtask

### Example Workflows

**Circuit Design Request:**
```
User: "Design an ESP32 development board with USB-C and LDO regulator"

orchestrator → architect (analyze requirements, plan circuit topology)  
architect → circuit-synth (find components, design circuit connections)
circuit-synth → code (implement Python circuit-synth code)
orchestrator → (coordinate testing, KiCad generation, validation)
```

**Code Enhancement Request:**
```
User: "Add a new placement algorithm for PCB components"

orchestrator → architect (analyze requirements, plan implementation)
architect → code (implement algorithm following best practices)  
orchestrator → (coordinate testing, documentation, integration)
```

**Research/Analysis Request:**
```
User: "Find all voltage regulator patterns used in existing circuits"

orchestrator → general-purpose (search codebase, analyze patterns)
general-purpose → architect (organize findings, identify patterns)
orchestrator → (coordinate documentation, recommendations)
```

## Repository Structure

### CRITICAL: Two Circuit-Synth Repositories

There are **TWO** distinct circuit-synth repositories that you must be aware of:

1. **Private Repository**: `Circuit_Synth2/` (closed source)
   - This is the original project where most functionality was initially developed
   - Contains the complete, mature implementation
   - Located at `/Users/shanemattner/Desktop/Circuit_Synth2/`
   - This is the private, closed-source version

2. **Open Source Repository**: `Circuit_Synth2/submodules/circuit-synth/` (open source)
   - This is the open-source version created as a submodule
   - Some functionality from the private repo was **not copied over properly**
   - Located at `/Users/shanemattner/Desktop/Circuit_Synth2/submodules/circuit-synth/`
   - **This is where all new development should happen**

### Development Guidelines

- **ALWAYS work in the open source repo**: `/Users/shanemattner/Desktop/Circuit_Synth2/submodules/circuit-synth/`
- When referencing functionality, be explicit about which repo you're looking at
- If functionality exists in the private repo but is missing from the open source repo, it needs to be ported over
- **Never make changes to the private repo** - all development goes in the open source version
- Keep track of which repo contains which functionality to avoid confusion

### Repository References

When discussing code or functionality:
- **Private repo**: Reference as "private Circuit_Synth2 repo" or "closed source repo"
- **Open source repo**: Reference as "open source circuit-synth repo" or "submodule repo"
- **Default assumption**: Unless specified otherwise, all work should be done in the **open source repo**

## Annotation System

The circuit-synth repository includes a comprehensive annotation system that enables automatic and manual documentation of Python-generated circuit designs. This system provides seamless integration between Python code documentation and KiCad schematic annotations.

### Overview

The annotation system consists of three main components:

1. **Decorator-based automatic annotations** - Extracts docstrings from decorated functions
2. **Manual annotation classes** - Provides structured annotation objects for custom documentation
3. **JSON export pipeline** - Serializes annotations to JSON for KiCad integration

### Key Components

#### 1. Decorator Flags (`@enable_comments`)

The `@enable_comments` decorator automatically extracts function docstrings and converts them into schematic annotations:

```python
from circuit_synth.annotations import enable_comments

@enable_comments
def create_amplifier_stage():
    """
    Creates a common-emitter amplifier stage.
    
    This circuit provides voltage amplification with a gain of approximately 100.
    Input impedance: ~1kΩ, Output impedance: ~3kΩ
    """
    # Circuit implementation...
    pass
```

#### 2. Manual Annotation Classes

Three annotation classes provide structured documentation capabilities:

**TextBox Annotations:**
```python
from circuit_synth.annotations import TextBox

# Create a text box annotation
note = TextBox(
    text="High-frequency bypass capacitor for supply rail filtering",
    position=(50, 30),
    size=(40, 15),
    style="note"
)
```

**TextProperty Annotations:**
```python
from circuit_synth.annotations import TextProperty

# Add property annotation to a component
component_note = TextProperty(
    text="R1: Sets bias current to 2.5mA",
    position=(10, 5),
    style="property"
)
```

**Table Annotations:**
```python
from circuit_synth.annotations import Table

# Create a specifications table
specs_table = Table(
    headers=["Parameter", "Min", "Typical", "Max", "Unit"],
    rows=[
        ["Supply Voltage", "3.0", "3.3", "3.6", "V"],
        ["Gain", "95", "100", "105", "dB"],
        ["Bandwidth", "1", "10", "20", "MHz"]
    ],
    position=(100, 50),
    title="Amplifier Specifications"
)
```

#### 3. JSON Export Pipeline

The annotation system includes a complete serialization pipeline that converts annotations to JSON format compatible with KiCad:

```python
from circuit_synth.annotations import export_annotations_to_json

# Export all annotations from a design
annotations = [text_box, component_note, specs_table]
json_output = export_annotations_to_json(annotations, "amplifier_design")
```

### Usage Examples

#### Automatic Annotation Workflow

1. **Decorate functions** with `@enable_comments` to enable automatic docstring extraction
2. **Write descriptive docstrings** following standard Python conventions
3. **Run the design generation** - annotations are captured automatically
4. **Export to JSON** for KiCad integration

```python
@enable_comments
def design_filter_circuit():
    """
    Second-order Butterworth low-pass filter.
    
    Cutoff frequency: 1kHz
    Roll-off: -40dB/decade above cutoff
    Input/Output impedance: 50Ω
    """
    # Implementation creates filter components
    return circuit
```

#### Manual Annotation Workflow

1. **Create annotation objects** during circuit generation
2. **Position annotations** relative to components or absolute coordinates
3. **Collect annotations** in a list or annotation manager
4. **Export to JSON** alongside automatic annotations

```python
def create_power_supply():
    # Create circuit components
    
    # Add manual annotations
    annotations = [
        TextBox(
            text="Regulation: ±0.1% line/load",
            position=(75, 25),
            style="specification"
        ),
        Table(
            headers=["Rail", "Voltage", "Current"],
            rows=[
                ["+5V", "5.00V", "2.0A"],
                ["-5V", "-5.00V", "0.5A"],
                ["+12V", "12.00V", "1.0A"]
            ],
            position=(120, 60),
            title="Power Rail Specifications"
        )
    ]
    
    return circuit, annotations
```

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Data Flow Architecture

The annotation system implements a robust data flow from Python generation to KiCad integration:

1. **Collection Phase**: Annotations are gathered during circuit generation
2. **Validation Phase**: Annotation objects are validated for completeness
3. **Serialization Phase**: Objects are converted to JSON with proper formatting
4. **Export Phase**: JSON is written with KiCad-compatible structure

#### S-expression Formatting Fixes

The system includes comprehensive S-expression formatting with proper string escaping for KiCad compatibility:

- **String Escaping**: Handles special characters in annotation text
- **Coordinate Formatting**: Ensures proper numeric formatting for positions
- **Style Mapping**: Maps annotation styles to KiCad text properties
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Maintains proper S-expression nesting

```python
# Example of formatted S-expression output
(text "High-frequency bypass capacitor" (at 50.8 76.2 0)
  (effects (font (size 1.27 1.27)) (justify left))
  (uuid "annotation-uuid-here")
)
```

#### JSON Schema Structure

The export pipeline follows a consistent JSON schema:

```json
{
  "design_name": "amplifier_design",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-27T10:30:00Z",
  "annotations": [
    {
      "type": "textbox",
      "id": "unique-id",
      "text": "annotation content",
      "position": {"x": 50, "y": 30},
      "size": {"width": 40, "height": 15},
      "style": "note",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "automatic|manual",
        "function": "function_name"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Integration with KiCad

The annotation system provides seamless integration with KiCad schematics:

1. **JSON Import**: KiCad can import the generated JSON files
2. **S-expression Compatibility**: All formatting follows KiCad standards
3. **Layer Management**: Annotations are placed on appropriate schematic layers
4. **UUID Tracking**: Each annotation receives a unique identifier for updates

This implementation provides a complete end-to-end solution for documenting Python-generated circuit designs with both automatic and manual annotation capabilities.

## Scalable Directory Structure

### IMPORTANT: Reorganized Source Structure

The repository has been reorganized with a scalable directory structure to support multiple chip families and manufacturers:

```

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Old import paths are updated but may need adjustment in legacy code
- New structure enables easy addition of chip families and manufacturers
- Each category provides clear separation of concerns and expertise domains

### Adding New Integrations

**To add a new component family:**
1. Create directory: `src/circuit_synth/component_info/[category]/[family]/`
2. Implement component-specific functionality (device search, configuration, etc.)  
3. Add proper `__init__.py` with clear API exports
4. Update relevant Claude agents and commands

**To add a new manufacturer:**
1. Create directory: `src/circuit_synth/manufacturing/[manufacturer]/`
2. Implement manufacturer-specific APIs (availability, pricing, constraints)
3. Follow JLCPCB integration patterns for consistency
4. Add manufacturing-specific validation and optimization

## Circuit-Synth Specific Knowledge

### Core Components and Patterns

**Component Creation:**
```python
# Standard component pattern
component = Component(
    symbol="Library:SymbolName",        # Use /find-symbol to locate
    ref="U",                           # Reference prefix (U, R, C, etc.)
    footprint="Library:FootprintName", # Use /find-footprint to locate
    value="optional_value"             # For passives (resistors, caps)
)
```

**Net Management:**
```python
# Create nets for connections
VCC_3V3 = Net('VCC_3V3')  # Descriptive names
GND = Net('GND')

# Connect components to nets
component["pin_name"] += net_name
component[1] += VCC_3V3  # Pin numbers for simple components
```

**Circuit Decorators:**
```python
@circuit(name="circuit_name")
def my_circuit():
    """Docstring becomes schematic annotation"""
    # Circuit implementation
    return circuit  # Optional explicit return
```

### Common Libraries and Footprints

**Microcontrollers:**
- ESP32: `RF_Module:ESP32-S3-MINI-1`
- STM32: `MCU_ST_STM32F4:STM32F407VETx` (use /find-symbol STM32)
- Arduino: `MCU_Module:Arduino_UNO_R3`

**Passives:**
- Resistors: `Device:R` with footprints like `Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric`
- Capacitors: `Device:C` with footprints like `Capacitor_SMD:C_0603_1608Metric`
- Inductors: `Device:L` with appropriate footprints

**Connectors:**
- USB-C: `Connector:USB_C_Receptacle_*` (search with /find-symbol)
- Headers: `Connector_Generic:Conn_01x*` or `Conn_02x*`
- Power jacks: `Connector:Barrel_Jack_*`

### KiCad Integration Best Practices

**Symbol and Footprint Naming:**
- Always use full library:name format
- Verify symbols exist before using (run /find-symbol first)
- Match footprint to component package exactly

**Net Naming Conventions:**
- Power nets: `VCC_5V`, `VCC_3V3`, `GND`
- Signal nets: `USB_DP`, `USB_DM`, descriptive names
- Avoid generic names like `Net1`, `Net2`

**Reference Designators:**
- Follow standard conventions: U (ICs), R (resistors), C (capacitors), L (inductors), J (connectors)
- Let circuit-synth auto-assign numbers: `ref="U"` becomes `U1`, `U2`, etc.

### Common Patterns

**Power Supply Design:**
```python
# Voltage regulator with decoupling
vreg = Component(symbol="Regulator_Linear:AMS1117-3.3", ref="U", footprint="Package_TO_SOT_SMD:SOT-223-3_TabPin2")
cap_in = Component(symbol="Device:C", ref="C", value="10uF", footprint="Capacitor_SMD:C_0805_2012Metric")
cap_out = Component(symbol="Device:C", ref="C", value="22uF", footprint="Capacitor_SMD:C_0805_2012Metric")
```

**USB Interface:**
```python
usb_conn = Component(symbol="Connector:USB_C_Receptacle_USB2.0", ref="J", footprint="Connector_USB:USB_C_Receptacle_*")
# Connect VBUS, GND, D+, D- appropriately
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Symbol/Footprint Not Found:**
- Use /find-symbol and /find-footprint commands
- Check exact spelling and capitalization
- Verify library names match KiCad standard libraries

**Net Connection Problems:**
- Ensure pin names match exactly (case sensitive)
- Use integers for simple component pins: `component[1]`, `component[2]`
- Use strings for named pins: `component["VCC"]`, `component["GND"]`

**KiCad Generation Issues:**
- Check that all components have valid symbols and footprints
- Verify net connections are complete (no unconnected pins)
- Ensure reference designators are unique and follow conventions
