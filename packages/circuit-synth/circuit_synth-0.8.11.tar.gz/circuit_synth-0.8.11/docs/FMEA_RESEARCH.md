# FMEA Research Documentation for Circuit Board Analysis

## Executive Summary

Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a systematic methodology for identifying potential failure modes in electronic circuit boards and PCB assemblies, assessing their impact, and prioritizing corrective actions. This document consolidates research findings on FMEA best practices specifically for electronics and circuit board applications.

## 1. FMEA Fundamentals

### Definition
FMEA is a proactive reliability engineering technique that:
- Identifies potential failure modes before they occur
- Evaluates the severity of failure effects
- Assesses the likelihood of occurrence
- Determines detection capabilities
- Prioritizes risk mitigation actions

### Types of FMEA for Electronics

1. **Design FMEA (DFMEA)**
   - Focuses on circuit topology and component selection
   - Analyzes design weaknesses and potential failure modes
   - Performed during the design phase

2. **Process FMEA (PFMEA)**
   - Examines manufacturing and assembly processes
   - Identifies process-related failure modes
   - Performed before production starts

## 2. Risk Assessment Methodology

### Risk Priority Number (RPN)
The traditional FMEA approach uses RPN calculation:
```
RPN = Severity (S) × Occurrence (O) × Detection (D)
```

- **Range**: 1 to 1000
- **Action Threshold**: Typically RPN > 125 requires corrective action
- **Goal**: Reduce RPN below threshold after mitigation

### Modern Action Priority (AP) Approach
Recent AIAG-VDA standards (2019) replace RPN with Action Priority tables:
- High Priority: Immediate action required
- Medium Priority: Action should be taken
- Low Priority: Action may be taken

This approach better accounts for high-severity failures regardless of occurrence or detection ratings.

## 3. Rating Scales

### Severity Scale (1-10)
| Rating | Description | PCB Example |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | No effect | Cosmetic defect on silkscreen |
| 2-3 | Minor annoyance | LED slightly dimmer than spec |
| 4-5 | Performance degradation | Reduced efficiency in power supply |
| 6-7 | Product inoperable (safe) | Circuit fails but no safety risk |
| 8-9 | Safety issue with warning | Overheating with thermal shutdown |
| 10 | Safety issue without warning | Fire hazard without protection |

### Occurrence Scale (1-10)
| Rating | Description | Failure Rate |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Remote | < 1 in 1,500,000 |
| 2-3 | Very low to low | 1 in 150,000 to 1 in 15,000 |
| 4-5 | Moderate | 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 400 |
| 6-7 | High | 1 in 80 to 1 in 20 |
| 8-9 | Very high | 1 in 8 to 1 in 3 |
| 10 | Certain | > 1 in 2 |

### Detection Scale (1-10)
| Rating | Description | Detection Method Example |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | Almost certain detection | Automated optical inspection |
| 2-3 | Very high to high chance | In-circuit testing |
| 4-5 | Moderate chance | Functional testing |
| 6-7 | Low chance | Random sampling |
| 8-9 | Very remote chance | Customer complaint only |
| 10 | No detection | No test coverage |

## 4. Common PCB Failure Modes

### Component Failures
- **Capacitors**: ESR increase, dielectric breakdown, electrolyte drying
- **Resistors**: Value drift, open circuit, thermal damage
- **Semiconductors**: Junction failure, latch-up, ESD damage
- **Inductors**: Core saturation, winding shorts

### Solder Joint Failures
- Cold solder joints
- Tombstoning
- Solder bridges
- Insufficient wetting
- Intermetallic compound growth
