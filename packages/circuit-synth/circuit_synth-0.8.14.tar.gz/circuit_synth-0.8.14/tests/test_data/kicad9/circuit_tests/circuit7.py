circuit7.py

Demonstrates pin-type edge cases:
  - An op amp symbol (TL081) which includes an NC pin (pin 8).
  - Power pins V+ and V-, connected to nets 12V and GND.
  - A no-connect pin is left unconnected and should appear
    as "pin_id": 8 with "func": "no_connect" in the JSON.

We verify that:
  - The NC pin remains unconnected.
  - Power pins appear in nets as usual.
  - Normal I/O pins can be connected or left out.
