Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to crawl a website using this tool:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Python Installation**: Ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n\n2. **Install advertools**: You can install `advertools` via pip. Open your command line or terminal and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install advertools\n   ```\n\n### Steps to Crawl a Website\n\n1. **Import the Necessary Libraries**: First, import the relevant functions from `advertools`.\n\n   ```python\n   import advertools as adv\n   ```\n\n2. **Crawl the Website**: Use the `crawl()` function to start the crawling process. You need to provide the URL of the site you want to crawl and a path to save the output file.\n\n   ```python\n   adv.crawl('https://example.com', 'output_file.jl', follow_links=True)\n   ```\n\n   **Parameters**:\n   - `'https://example.com'`: Replace this with the URL of the website you want to crawl.\n   - `'output_file.jl'`: The path for the output file where the crawling results will be saved.\n   - `follow_links=True`: This parameter determines if the crawler should follow links from the pages it visits. Setting it to `False` will limit crawling to the main page.\n\n3. **Examine the Output**: The result is stored in a `.jl` (JSON Lines) file. You can read it with Python or convert it into a more convenient format like a DataFrame using libraries like `pandas`.\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Load the crawl results\n   crawl_results = pd.read_json('output_file.jl', lines=True)\n\n   # Display the first few rows\n   print(crawl_results.head())\n   ```\n\n### Additional Options\n\n- **Restrict by Domains**: You can restrict crawling to specific domains by setting parameters within the `crawl()` function.\n- **Control Depth**: Adjust the depth of crawling to control how far the crawler should go when following links.\n\n### Tips and Best Practices\n\n- **Respect Robots.txt**: Ensure that your crawling activities respect the `robots.txt` file of the website.\n- **Rate Limiting**: Be cautious about the rate at which you send requests to a server to avoid being blocked.\n- **Ethical Considerations**: Always adhere to legal and ethical guidelines when crawling websites.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively use `advertools` to crawl websites and extract data for your analysis.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1754817782, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_07871e2ad8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 581, "prompt_tokens": 20, "total_tokens": 601, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}
