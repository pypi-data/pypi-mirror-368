Here are three thoughtful gift ideas for Mother's Day:\n\n1. **Personalized Jewelry**: Consider gifting a piece of jewelry that can be personalized, such as a necklace or bracelet with her initials, birthstone, or the names of her children engraved on it. This adds a sentimental touch that she's likely to cherish.\n\n2. **Spa Day or Subscription Box**: Treat her to a day of relaxation with a gift certificate to a local spa, or give her a subscription box for beauty and self-care products. Options like bath bombs, scented candles, or skincare products can provide ongoing pampering experiences at home.\n\n3. **Custom Photo Album or Frame**: Create a custom photo album filled with memorable pictures from family events and special occasions. Alternatively, you could opt for a digital photo frame that rotates through a selection of family photos, making for a lovely and personal gift.\n\nThese gifts can be tailored to your mother's tastes and preferences, adding a heartfelt dimension to her special day.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1754821119, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_07871e2ad8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 198, "prompt_tokens": 16, "total_tokens": 214, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}
