    "content": "A haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry characterized by three unrhymed lines with a specific syllable pattern. In its classic Japanese form, a haiku consists of:\n\n1. First line: 5 syllables\n2. Second line: 7 syllables\n3. Third line: 5 syllables\n\nHaiku typically capture a brief moment in time, often related to nature, and try to create a sudden insight or awareness. They often include a seasonal reference (kigo) and aim to create a simple, evocative image or feeling.\n\nHere's an example of a classic haiku by the famous Japanese poet Matsuo Bash≈ç:\n\nAn old silent pond...\nA frog jumps into the pond,\nsplash! Silence again.\n\nIn English, poets sometimes take more liberties with the strict 5-7-5 syllable structure, but the spirit of brevity and capturing a moment remains the same."
