    "content": "An opus is a creative work, especially a musical composition, usually numbered to designate the order of a composer's works. The word \"opus\" is Latin for \"work\" or \"labor.\"\n\nIn classical music, an opus number is assigned to a composition or set of compositions to indicate the chronological order of the composer's works. Opus numbers are typically assigned by the composer, but sometimes by music publishers. For example, Beethoven's famous piano sonata \"Moonlight Sonata\" is more formally known as \"Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 2,\" where \"Op. 27\" stands for Opus 27.\n\nHowever, the term \"opus\" has also been adopted in other fields to refer to any artistic work, such as a literary piece or a broader collection of creative works by an artist. In this context, it is often used to signify a substantial or important work.\n\nIt's worth noting that not all composers used opus numbers, and some used them inconsistently. Additionally, some composers, such as Bach and Mozart, didn't use opus numbers at all; their works are often referred to by other catalog systems, such as the BWV (Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis) numbers for Bach or the K. (Köchel) numbers for Mozart."
