Here's a simple Python function to add two numbers, `x` and `y`:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = add_numbers(3, 5)\nprint(\"The sum is:\", result)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We've defined a function named `add_numbers` that takes two parameters, `x` and `y`.\n- The function returns the result of adding these two numbers.\n- We then call the function with the example arguments `3` and `5` and print the result, which should output `The sum is: 8`. \n\nFeel free to change the input values to see how the function works with other numbers!"

    "content": "Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python is a mechanism that determines the sequence in which base classes are searched when executing a method in the presence of multiple inheritance. Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to establish a consistent order that respects the hierarchy and ensures every class is considered only once. The `mro()` method or the `__mro__` attribute can be used to view this order. MRO helps resolve potential conflicts in multiple inheritance by providing a clear path to follow when a method is called, ensuring predictable and consistent behavior in class hierarchies. This order is crucial to avoid ambiguity and maintain proper class relationships and behaviors in complex inheritance scenarios."
