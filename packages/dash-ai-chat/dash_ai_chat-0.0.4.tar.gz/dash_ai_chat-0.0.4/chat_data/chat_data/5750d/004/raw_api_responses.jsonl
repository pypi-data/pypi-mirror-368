It contains antioxidants and can improve mental alertness and cognitive function. Some studies suggest it may reduce the risk of certain diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and type 2 diabetes.\n\n- **Potential Drawbacks**: On the other hand, excessive consumption can lead to negative side effects such as insomnia, jitters, elevated heart rate, and gastrointestinal issues. People with certain medical conditions or who are sensitive to caffeine might find it adversely affects their health.\n\n- **Personal Preference**: Taste and preference vary widely among individuals. Some people love the flavor and routine of coffee, while others don't enjoy it at all.\n\nUltimately, whether coffee is \"good\" for you or not depends on how your body reacts to it and how you choose to incorporate it into your lifestyle.
