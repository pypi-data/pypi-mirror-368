    "content": "The number of calories you need to consume each day depends on several factors, including your age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and overall health goals. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Sedentary Lifestyle**:\n   - Women: Approximately 1,800 to 2,000 calories per day\n   - Men: Approximately 2,200 to 2,400 calories per day\n\n2. **Moderately Active Lifestyle** (light physical activity or moderate exercise):\n   - Women: Approximately 2,000 to 2,200 calories per day\n   - Men: Approximately 2,400 to 2,600 calories per day\n\n3. **Active Lifestyle** (regular intense exercise or physical activity):\n   - Women: Approximately 2,200 to 2,400 calories per day\n   - Men: Approximately 2,600 to 3,000 calories per day\n\nTo maintain, lose, or gain weight, you may need to adjust your calorie intake. On average, consuming 500 fewer calories per day than your body needs may result in a weight loss of about 1 pound per week. Conversely, consuming 500 more calories than your body needs may result in weight gain at a similar rate.\n\nFor a more accurate estimate tailored to your personal needs, using tools like the Harris-Benedict Equation or consulting with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian is recommended."
