Here is a table listing the planets with an interesting fact related to mythology:\n\n| Planet  | Interesting Fact |\n|---------|------------------|\n| **Mercury** | Named after the Roman messenger god Mercury, known for his speed, mirroring the planet's quick orbit around the Sun. |\n| **Venus**   | Named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, reflecting the planet's bright, shining appearance in the sky. |\n| **Earth**   | Earth is the only planet not named after a Greek or Roman deity; its name comes from Old English and Germanic words for ground. |\n| **Mars**    | Named after the Roman god of war, Mars, due to its red color reminiscent of blood and warfare. |\n| **Jupiter** | Named after the king of the Roman gods, Jupiter, as the largest planet reflects his status in the pantheon. |\n| **Saturn**  | Named after the Roman god of agriculture and time, Saturn, and known for its extensive ring system. |\n| **Uranus**  | Uniquely named after a Greek deity rather than a Roman one; Uranus is the Greek god of the sky, and the planet has a peculiar blue color. |\n| **Neptune** | Named after the Roman god of the sea, Neptune, due to the planetâ€™s deep blue color reminiscent of the ocean. |\n\nI hope you find these mythological connections interesting!"
