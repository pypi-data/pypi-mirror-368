Hereâ€™s a simple Python function that takes in two numbers `x` and `y` and returns their sum:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = add_numbers(3, 5)\nprint(\"The sum is:\", result)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We define a function called `add_numbers` that accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`.\n- The function returns the sum of `x` and `y`.\n- We then call the function with the values `3` and `5`, assigning the result to a variable named `result`.\n- Finally, we print the result to the console.\n\nIf you have any questions about how this works or want to modify it, feel free to ask!"
