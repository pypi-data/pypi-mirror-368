Here's a simple Python function that adds two numbers, `x` and `y`, and returns the result:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = add_numbers(3, 5)\nprint(\"The sum is:\", result)\n```\n\nThis function takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, and uses the `+` operator to add them together. You can then use this function by passing the numbers you want to add as arguments. For example, `add_numbers(3, 5)` will return `8`. Let me know if you have any questions or need further help!"
