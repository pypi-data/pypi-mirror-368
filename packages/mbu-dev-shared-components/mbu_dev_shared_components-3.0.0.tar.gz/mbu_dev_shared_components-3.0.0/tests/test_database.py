Module to test RPAConnection functionalities in the Solteq Tand system

Tested functionalities:

    - Establish database connection:
        Function:
            RPAConnection.__enter__
        Assertion:
            Connection and cursor are not None
        Dependencies:
            None

    - Add and retrieve constant:
        Function:
            RPAConnection.add_constant, RPAConnection.get_constant
        Assertion:
            Constant is correctly inserted and retrieved
        Dependencies:
            test_connection

    - Add and retrieve credential:
        Function:
            RPAConnection.add_credential, RPAConnection.get_credential
        Assertion:
            Credential is correctly inserted and retrieved
        Dependencies:
            test_connection

    - Rollback functionality:
        Function:
            RPAConnection.__exit__
        Assertion:
            Constant added without commit is not persisted
        Dependencies:
            test_connection, test_add_get_constant

    - Log event:
        Function:
            RPAConnection.log_event, RPAConnection.get_latest_log
        Assertion:
            Log entry is correctly inserted and retrieved
        Dependencies:
            None

    - Heartbeat logging (stop as string):
        Function:
            RPAConnection.log_heartbeat, RPAConnection.get_heartbeat
        Assertion:
            Heartbeat status is "STOPPED"
        Dependencies:
            None

    - Heartbeat logging (stop as boolean):
        Function:
            RPAConnection.log_heartbeat, RPAConnection.get_heartbeat
        Assertion:
            Heartbeat status is "STOPPED"
        Dependencies:
            None

    - Run heartbeat process:
        Function:
            External subprocess running heartbeat_worker.py
        Assertion:
            Heartbeat status is "RUNNING" and updates over time
        Dependencies:
            None

Requirements:
    - Database environment variable `TEST` must be configured
    - pyodbc must be installed and accessible
    - mbu_dev_shared_components must be available in PYTHONPATH
    - `heartbeat_worker.py` must exist in the `tests/` directory and be executable
    - `.venv/Scripts/python` must point to the correct Python interpreter
Further description:
    Each test uses the RPAConnection context manager to ensure proper handling of database transactions.
    COMMIT is set to False to test rollback behavior and avoid persistent changes to the test database.
    Heartbeat and logging tests validate time-sensitive operations with a threshold of 0.5 seconds.
    The heartbeat process test (`test_run_heartbeat`) runs a parallel subprocess to simulate real-time heartbeat updates.
