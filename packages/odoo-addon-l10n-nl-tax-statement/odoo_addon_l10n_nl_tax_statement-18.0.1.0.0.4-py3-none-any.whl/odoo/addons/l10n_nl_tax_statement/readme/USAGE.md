To create a statement you need to:

1.  Verify that you have enough permits. You need to belong at least to
    the *Billing Manager* or the *Accountant* group.
2.  Go to the menu: Invoicing -\> Reporting \> NL BTW Statement
3.  Create a statement, providing a name and specifying start date and
    end date
4.  Press the Update button to calculate the report: the report lines
    will be displayed in the tab Statement
5.  Manually enter the BTW amounts of lines '5d', '5e', '5f' (in Edit
    mode, click on the amount of the line to be able to change it)
6.  Press the Post button to set the status of the statement to Posted;
    the statements set to this state cannot be modified

To add past undeclared invoices/moves:

1.  Open the tab Past Undeclared Moves, available when the statement is
    in status Draft.
2.  Set an initial date (field From Date) from which the past undeclared
    moves will be displayed.
3.  One by one, add the displayed undeclared moves, by clicking on the
    Add Move button present in each line.
4.  Press the Update button in order to recompute the statement lines.

Extra info about the workflow:

1.  If you need to recalculate or modify or delete a statement already
    set to Posted status you need first to set it back to Draft status:
    press the button Reset to Draft
2.  Instead, if you send the statement to the Tax Authority, you may
    want to avoid that the statement is set back to Draft: to avoid
    this, press the button Final. If you then confirm, it will be not
    possible to modify this Statement or reset it back to draft anymore.

    click: Print -\> NL Tax Statement

2.  To create one tax statement for a fiscal unit, log in into the
    parent company and select the child companies in the statement (be
    sure the user belongs to the multicompany group).
3.  The child companies must have the same Tax codes labels (Tax Tags)
    as the parent company, the same currency as the parent company and
