## What is BeeAI Framework?

BeeAI Framework is a comprehensive toolkit for building intelligent, autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. It provides everything you need to create agents that can reason, take actions, and collaborate to solve complex problems.

> [!TIP]
> Get started quickly with the [beeai-framework-py-starter](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework-py-starter) template.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |

            )
            .on(
