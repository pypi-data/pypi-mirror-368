### Postgreslq Initialization

```sql
CREATE DATABASE trade_data;
CREATE USER tradedbadmin WITH PASSWORD 'trade_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE trade_data TO tradedbadmin;
\connect trade_data;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO tradedbadmin;
```

Add the following lines in the `pg_hba.conf` file to allow password authentication for the `tradedbadmin` role.

```
# trade database
host    all            tradedbadmin     0.0.0.0/0               scram-sha-256
host    all            tradedbadmin     ::/0                    scram-sha-256
```

### KDB+ Initialization

#### get license
Request a 64-bit license from [Kx Systems](https://kx.com/kdb-insights-personal-edition-license-download). Fill the form
then the system will send an email with the license file and a base64 key (Either can be used to license the product).

#### Server side (Linux system)
1. Put the executable `q` and license in desired folder, say `/opt/l64` directory.
2. Create a folder to store the data, say `/opt/data` directory.
3. Set the environment variable `QLIC` to the directory where the license file is stored. And `QHOME` to the data directory.
4. Run the `q` executable with the following command:
    ```bash
    $ q -p 5000 -s 1 -w 100 -t 1000 -T 1000 -U /opt/l64/trade.q
    ```
   - `-p 5000`: This sets the port number for the kdb+ process. In this case, the port number is 5000.

   - `-s 1`: This sets the number of secondary threads. In this case, it's set to 1.

   - `-w 100`: This sets the workspace heap size. In this case, it's set to 100 MB.

   - `-t 1000`: This sets the timer interval in milliseconds. In this case, it's set to 1000 milliseconds, or 1 second.

   - `-T 1000`: This sets the timeout in seconds for client queries. In this case, it's set to 1000 seconds.

   - `-U /opt/l64/trade.q`: This sets the access control list file. In this case, the file is located at `/opt/l64/trade.q`. This file contains a list of usernames and passwords for clients that are allowed to connect to the kdb+ process.

### MetaData Initialization

Allowed instruments types are given in "Instrument Types" section of [meta_enumerations.md](doc/meta_enumerations.md).

### Data Initialization for Instrument Type(s)
```python
from trade_database_manager.manager import MetadataSql

metadatalib = MetadataSql()
metadatalib.initialize(for_inst_types="CB")
```

This will try to create two tables, `instruments` and `instruments_cb` in the database if not yet exists. The `instruments` table will store the common information of all instruments, and the `instruments_cb` table will store the type-specific information of the instruments of type `CB`.

The table fields are listed in the [data_organization.md](doc/data_organization.md) file.
