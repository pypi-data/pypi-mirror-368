## Locate the file and Setup Environment Variables
 - Unzip the zip file `[x]64.zip`, It contains a `q.k` file and a `[x]64.zip` file where `[x]` is different by target system (`w` for Windows, `l` for Linux, `m` for MacOS),
 - Place `q` in a desired location, e.g. `/opt/l64/q` for Linux, `C:\l64\q` for Windows, then add the path to the environment variable `PATH`;
 - Place `kc.lic` in the same folder as `q`, then add the path to the environment variable `QLIC`;
 - Decide where you want to store the data, and put `q.k` file in that folder and add the path to the environment variable `QHOME`, such as `/var/lib/kdb/q`.

## Test the Installation
 - Open a terminal, type `q` and press enter, you should see a welcome message and a `q)` prompt;
 - Type `2+3` and press enter, you should see `5` as the result;
 - Type `.z.K` and press enter, you should see a date and time string like `2020.12.31T23:59:59.999`.
 
## Utility Scripts
   Put the `trade_database_manager/core/kdb/qscripts/q.q` file in `QHOME` folder, so that the utility scripts loaded automatically when `q` starts.

## Register `q` as a System Service as a Database Server (Linux)
 - Create an environment variable file `q.env` in the same folder as `q` and `kc.lic`, and add the following lines:
   ```bash
   printf "QHOME=<path to q.k file (and other q script)>\nQLIC=<path to license file>\n" | sudo tee /opt/l64/kdbenv
   ```
 
 - Create folder for data storage, e.g. `/var/lib/kdb/data` and set the owner to the user who will run the service:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /var/lib/kdb/data
   sudo chown <username>:<group> /var/lib/kdb
   ```
   
 - (Optional) For Authentication
   Create a user-password file for kdb+ authentication:
   ```bash
   printf "username:password" | sudo tee /var/lib/kdb/q/userpass
   ```

 - Create a service file `kdb.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/` and add the following lines:
      ```bash
      sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/kdb.service
      ```
      ```ini
      [Unit]
      Description=KDB+ Q Service
      After=network.target
       
      [Service]
      EnvironmentFile=/opt/l64/kdbenv
      ExecStart=/opt/l64/q -p 5000 -U <path to userpass file> -u 1
      WorkingDirectory=<path to data folder>
      User=<username>
      Group=<group>
      Restart=always
      RestartSec=1
       
      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target
      ```
      - If no authentication is needed, remove `-U <path to userpass file> -u 1` from `ExecStart` line.
