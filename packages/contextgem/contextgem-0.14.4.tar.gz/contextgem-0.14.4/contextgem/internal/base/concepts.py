    """
    Base class for all concept types in the ContextGem framework.

    A concept represents a specific unit of information to be extracted from documents.
    It can be derived from an aspect or directly from document content, capturing
    meaningful data points such as names, dates, values, or conclusions.

    :ivar name: The name of the concept.
    :vartype name: str
    :ivar description: A brief description of the concept.
    :vartype description: str
    :ivar llm_role: The role of the LLM when processing this concept.
        Options: "extractor_text", "reasoner_text", "extractor_vision", "reasoner_vision".
        Defaults to "extractor_text".
    :vartype llm_role: LLMRoleAny
    :ivar add_justifications: Whether to include justifications for extracted items.
        Defaults to False.
    :vartype add_justifications: StrictBool
    :ivar justification_depth: Detail level for justifications. Defaults to "brief".
    :vartype justification_depth: JustificationDepth
    :ivar justification_max_sents: Maximum number of sentences in a justification.
        Defaults to 2.
    :vartype justification_max_sents: StrictInt
    :ivar add_references: Whether to include references for extracted items.
        Defaults to False.
    :vartype add_references: StrictBool
    :ivar reference_depth: Structural depth of references ("paragraphs" or "sentences").
        Defaults to "paragraphs". Only relevant when references are added to extracted items.
        Affects the structure of ``extracted_items``.
    :vartype reference_depth: ReferenceDepth
    :ivar singular_occurrence: Whether this concept is restricted to having only one extracted item.
        If True, only a single extracted item will be extracted. Defaults to False (multiple
        extracted items are allowed). Note that with advanced LLMs, this constraint may not be
        strictly required as they can often infer the appropriate number of items to extract
        from the concept's name, description, and type.
    :vartype singular_occurrence: StrictBool
