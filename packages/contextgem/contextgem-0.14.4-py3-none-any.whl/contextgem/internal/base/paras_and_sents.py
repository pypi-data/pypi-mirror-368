"""
Module providing base classes for document paragraphs and sentences.

This module defines the foundational classes used for representing and managing
paragraphs and sentences within documents. It includes the _ParasAndSentsBase class
which serves as the common ancestor for paragraph and sentence implementations,
providing shared validation and context handling functionality.
