"""
Module defining the base classes for example subclasses.

This module provides the foundational class structure for examples that can be used
in the ContextGem framework. Examples serve as user-provided samples for extraction tasks,
helping to guide and improve the extraction process by providing reference patterns
or expected outputs.
