## HL Gauss - Pytorch

The Gaussian Histogram Loss (HL-Gauss) proposed by [Imani et al.](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/imani18a/imani18a.pdf) with a few convenient wrappers, in Pytorch.

A team at Deepmind wrote a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03950) with a lot of positive findings for its use in value-based RL.

Put into action [here](https://github.com/lucidrains/phasic-policy-gradient), seems to work well

## Install

```bash
$ pip install hl-gauss-pytorch
```

## Usage

The `HLGaussLoss` module as defined in Appendix A. of the [Stop Regressing paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03950)

```python
import torch
from hl_gauss_pytorch import HLGaussLoss

hl_gauss = HLGaussLoss(
    min_value = 0.,
    max_value = 5.,
    num_bins = 32,
    sigma = 0.5,
    clamp_to_range = True # this was added because if any values fall outside of the bins, the loss is 0 with the current logic
)

logits = torch.randn(3, 16, 32).requires_grad_()
targets = torch.randint(0, 5, (3, 16)).float()

loss = hl_gauss(logits, targets)
loss.backward()

# after much training

pred_target = hl_gauss(logits) # (3, 16)
```

For a convenient layer that predicts from embedding to logits, import `HLGaussLayer`

```python
import torch
from hl_gauss_pytorch import HLGaussLayer

hl_gauss_layer = HLGaussLayer(
    dim = 256, # input embedding dimension
    hl_gauss_loss = dict(
        min_value = 0.,
        max_value = 5.,
        num_bins = 32,
        sigma = 0.5,
    )
)

embed = torch.randn(7, 256)
targets = torch.randint(0, 5, (7,)).float()

loss = hl_gauss_layer(embed, targets)
loss.backward()

# after much training

pred_target = hl_gauss_layer(embed) # (7,)
```

For ablating the proposal, you can make the `HLGaussLayer` fall back to regular regression by setting `use_regression = True`, keeping the code above unchanged

```python
HLGaussLayer(..., use_regression = True)
```
