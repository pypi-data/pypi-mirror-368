# Rapyuta.io Python SDK

Rapyuta.io Python SDK enables you to access platform services and resources in
your python applications.

The SDK supports Python 3.8+. For older Python 2.x support, you can use the
0.x.x [releases](https://pypi.org/project/rapyuta-io/#history) from Pypi.

## Install

The SDK is distributed through PyPi index, and can be installed directly using `pip`.

```bash
pip install rapyuta-io
```

To install the SDK from source, you can use the `setup.py` script directly.
Clone the repository and from the root of the directory, run the following
command.

``` bash
python setup.py install
```

## Development

Create a python virtual environment, having version less than 3.11

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

## Getting Started

Before using the SDK, you need the Rapyuta Token. You can get it from
[here](https://auth.rapyuta.io/authToken/).

``` python
from rapyuta_io import Client

TOKEN = "RAPYUTA_TOKEN"


client = rapyuta_io.Client(TOKEN)

# Create a Project and use it
from rapyuta_io import Project

project = client.create_project(Project("python-sdk"))
client.set_project(project.guid)
```

## SDK Test

`RIO_CONFIG` environment variable pointing to the config.json must be sourced to 
run the sdk integration test. The sample config is present in `sdk_test` directory.
Run `run_rio_sdk_test.py` to start the sdk tests.

Currently only one docker compose device is needed to be created and added to the config, 
SDK Test will add the device to the newly created project and onboard it and run tests.
