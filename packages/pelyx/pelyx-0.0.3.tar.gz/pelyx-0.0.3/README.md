# Pelyx

Pelyx is a terminal editor written in Python. It plans to be a modal editor just like vi/vim/neovim/helix. This is a personal project just for learning and enjoyment.

Pelyx is built on [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), so it can run on different platforms including Linux, MacOS, Windows 10/11.

This project is open-sourced under MulanPSL-2.0.
