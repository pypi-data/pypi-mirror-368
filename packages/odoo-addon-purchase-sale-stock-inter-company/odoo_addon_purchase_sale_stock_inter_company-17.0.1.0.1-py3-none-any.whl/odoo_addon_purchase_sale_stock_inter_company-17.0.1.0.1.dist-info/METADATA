This module is a glue module and is auto installed if
purchase_sale_inter_company, sale_stock and purchase_stock modules are
installed. Full purpose description can be found in
purchase_sale_inter_company.

In addition to the features provided by purchase_sale_inter_company,
which automatically creates inter-company Sale Orders from Purchase
Orders, this module extends the functionality by automatically
validating the corresponding inter-company receipts when the Delivery
Order is confirmed. During this process, lot/serial numbers and
quantities are synchronized to ensure consistency across companies.

The configuration includes an option to specify a default Warehouse that
will be automatically assigned to Sale Orders generated from Purchase
Orders addressed to this company.

When Company A sends a product tracked by lot or serial number, a new
lot/serial number with the same name is created in Company B to match
it, if one doesn't already exist.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to: #. Go to the menu *Settings >
General Settings*. #. Go to the tab *Companies / Inter Company OCA
features*, in the group *Purchase/Sale*, check the option *Sale from
purchase*. #. Then, select the *Warehouse for Sale Orders*, it is the
warehouse that will be used to automatically generate the sale order in
the other company.

1. If you check the option "Sync picking" (for both companies),
   validating a picking generated by an inter-company purchase/sale will
   validate the respective picking for the other company.
2. If you check the option "Block manual validation of picking in the
   destination company" is not possible to validate manually the picking
   in the destination company.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Module is not very robust in complex situations, such as multi-step
  receipts and multi-step deliveries, with backorders. Multi-step
  receipts could be improved further.
- This module does not sync packages.
