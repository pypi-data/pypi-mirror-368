# LitAI

AI-powered literature review assistant that understands your research questions and automatically finds papers, extracts insights, and synthesizes findings - all through natural conversation.

## Why LitAI?

LitAI accelerates your research by turning hours of paper reading into minutes of focused insights:

- **Find relevant papers fast**: Natural language search across millions of papers
- **Extract key insights**: AI reads papers and pulls out claims with evidence
- **Synthesize findings**: Ask questions across multiple papers and get cited answers
- **Build your collection**: Manage PDFs locally with automatic downloads from ArXiv

Perfect for:
- Literature reviews for research papers
- Understanding a new field quickly  
- Finding solutions to technical problems
- Discovering contradictions in existing work
- Building comprehensive reading lists

üí° **Tip**: Use the `/questions` command to see research unblocking questions organized by phase - from debugging experiments to contextualizing results.

## Installation

<summary>Advanced Configuration</summary>

Configure LitAI using the `/config` command:
```bash
# Show current configuration
/config show

# Set provider and model

## Getting Started

### 1. Launch LitAI
```bash
litai
```

### 2. Set Up Your Research Context (Recommended)
Provide context about your research to get more tailored responses:

```bash
/prompt
```

This opens your default editor with a template where you can describe:
- **Research Context**: Your area of study and current focus
- **Background & Expertise**: Your academic/professional background
- **Specific Interests**: Particular topics, methods, or problems you're investigating  
- **Preferences**: How you prefer information to be presented or synthesized

**Example research context:**
```markdown
## Research Context
I'm a PhD student researching efficient transformer architectures for edge deployment. Currently focusing on knowledge distillation and pruning techniques for large language models.

## Background & Expertise
- Strong background in deep learning and PyTorch
- Experience with model compression techniques
- Familiar with transformer architectures and attention mechanisms

## Specific Interests
- Structured pruning methods that maintain model accuracy
- Hardware-aware neural architecture search
- Quantization techniques for transformers

## Preferences
- When synthesizing papers, please highlight actual compression ratios achieved
- I prefer concrete numbers over vague claims
- Interested in both positive and negative results
```

**Why this matters**: This context gets automatically included in every AI conversation, helping LitAI understand your expertise level and tailor responses accordingly. Without it, LitAI treats every user the same way.

### 3. Understanding LitAI's Two Modes

**Normal Mode** - Build your research context:
```bash
normal ‚ñ∏ "Find papers about attention mechanisms"
normal ‚ñ∏ "Add the Transformer paper to my collection"  
normal ‚ñ∏ /papers                    # View your collection
normal ‚ñ∏ /note 1                    # Add personal notes
normal ‚ñ∏ /tag 1 -a transformers     # Organize with tags
```

**Synthesis Mode** - Ask questions and analyze:
```bash
normal ‚ñ∏ /synthesize                # Enter synthesis mode
synthesis ‚ñ∏ "What are the key findings across my transformer papers?"
synthesis ‚ñ∏ "How do attention mechanisms work?"
synthesis ‚ñ∏ "Compare BERT vs GPT architectures" 
synthesis ‚ñ∏ "Go deeper on the mathematical foundations"
synthesis ‚ñ∏ exit                    # Return to normal mode
```

**The Workflow:**
1. **Normal Mode**: Search, collect, and organize papers
2. **Synthesis Mode**: Ask research questions and get AI analysis
3. **Switch freely**: `/synthesize` to enter, `exit` to return

### 4. Build Your Research Workflow

**For New Research Areas:**
1. **Normal Mode**: `"Find recent papers about [topic]"` + `"Add the most cited papers"`
2. **Synthesis Mode**: `"What are the main approaches in this field?"` + follow-up questions

**For Literature Reviews:**
1. **Normal Mode**: Build collection, add notes (`/note`), organize with tags (`/tag`)
2. **Synthesis Mode**: `"Compare methodologies across my papers"` + deep analysis questions

**For Keeping Current:**
1. **Normal Mode**: `/questions` ‚Üí See research-unblocking prompts by phase
2. **Synthesis Mode**: Regular Q&A sessions to connect new papers to existing work

> **Key Insight**: Normal mode = building context, Synthesis mode = asking questions

### Normal Mode vs Synthesis Mode

**Normal Mode** - Context building and management:
```bash
/find <query>          # Search for papers  
/add <numbers>         # Add papers from search results
/papers [page]         # List your collection
/note <number>         # Add your personal notes
/tag <number> -a <tags>  # Add tags to papers
/synthesize            # Enter synthesis mode
```

**Synthesis Mode** - Question answering and analysis:
```bash
synthesis ‚ñ∏ "What are the key insights from paper X?"
synthesis ‚ñ∏ "How do these approaches compare?"
synthesis ‚ñ∏ "Go deeper on the methodology"
synthesis ‚ñ∏ "Add AI notes to paper 1"     # Ask AI to generate analysis notes
synthesis ‚ñ∏ /papers                       # Show full collection
synthesis ‚ñ∏ /selected                     # Show papers in current session  
synthesis ‚ñ∏ /context key_points           # Change context depth
synthesis ‚ñ∏ /clear                        # Clear session (keep selected papers)
synthesis ‚ñ∏ exit                          # Return to normal mode
```

## FAQ

### Why do paper searches sometimes fail?

Semantic Scholar's public API can experience high load, leading to search failures. If you encounter frequent issues:
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Consider requesting a free API key for higher rate limits: [Semantic Scholar API Key Form](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key-form)
