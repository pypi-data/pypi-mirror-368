"""
IM2Deep: Deep learning framework for peptide collisional cross section prediction.

IM2Deep is a Python package that provides accurate CCS (Collisional Cross Section)
prediction for peptides and modified peptides using deep learning models trained
specifically for TIMS (Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry) data.

Key Features:
    - Single-conformer CCS prediction using ensemble of neural networks
    - Multi-conformer CCS prediction for peptides with multiple conformations
    - Linear calibration using reference datasets
    - Support for modified peptides
    - Ion mobility conversion utilities
    - Command-line interface for easy usage

Example:
    Basic usage for CCS prediction:

    >>> from im2deep.im2deep import predict_ccs
    >>> from psm_utils.psm_list import PSMList
    >>> predictions = predict_ccs(psm_list, calibration_data)

Dependencies:
    - deeplc: For deep learning model infrastructure
    - psm_utils: For peptide and PSM handling
    - pandas: For data manipulation
    - numpy: For numerical computations
    - click: For command-line interface
