        """
        
        
        
        Args:
            input: Path to the input image you want to enhance.
            
            seed: Random seed to ensure reproducibility. Setting this ensures that multiple runs with the same input produce the same output. Defaults to 231.
            
            steps: The number of enhancement iterations to perform. More steps might result in a clearer image but can also introduce artifacts. Defaults to 50.
            
            tiled: Whether to use patch-based sampling. This can be useful for very large images to enhance them in smaller chunks rather than all at once. Defaults to False.
            
            tile_size: Size of each tile (or patch) when 'tiled' option is enabled. Determines how the image is divided during patch-based enhancement. Defaults to 512.
            
            has_aligned: For 'faces' mode: Indicates if the input images are already cropped and aligned to faces. If not, the model will attempt to do this. Defaults to False.
            
            tile_stride: Distance between the start of each tile when the image is divided for patch-based enhancement. A smaller stride means more overlap between tiles. Defaults to 256.
            
            repeat_times: Number of times the enhancement process is repeated by feeding the output back as input. This can refine the result but might also introduce over-enhancement issues. Defaults to 1.
            
            use_guidance: Use latent image guidance for enhancement. This can help in achieving more accurate and contextually relevant enhancements. Defaults to False.
            
            color_fix_type: Method used for color correction post enhancement. 'wavelet' and 'adain' offer different styles of color correction, while 'none' skips this step. Defaults to 'wavelet'.
            
            guidance_scale: For 'general_scenes': Scale factor for the guidance mechanism. Adjusts the influence of guidance on the enhancement process. Defaults to 0.0.
            
            guidance_space: For 'general_scenes': Determines in which space (RGB or latent) the guidance operates. 'latent' can often provide more subtle and context-aware enhancements. Defaults to 'latent'.
            
            guidance_repeat: For 'general_scenes': Number of times the guidance process is repeated during enhancement. Defaults to 5.
            
            only_center_face: For 'faces' mode: If multiple faces are detected, only enhance the center-most face in the image. Defaults to False.
            
            guidance_time_stop: For 'general_scenes': Specifies when (at which step) the guidance mechanism stops influencing the enhancement. Defaults to -1.
            
            guidance_time_start: For 'general_scenes': Specifies when (at which step) the guidance mechanism starts influencing the enhancement. Defaults to 1001.
            
            background_upsampler: For 'faces' mode: Model used to upscale the background in images where the primary subject is a face. Defaults to 'RealESRGAN'.
            
            face_detection_model: For 'faces' mode: Model used for detecting faces in the image. Choose based on accuracy and speed preferences. Defaults to 'retinaface_resnet50'.
            
            upscaling_model_type: Choose the type of model best suited for the primary content of the image: 'faces' for portraits and 'general_scenes' for everything else. Defaults to 'general_scenes'.
            
            restoration_model_type: Select the restoration model that aligns with the content of your image. This model is responsible for image restoration which removes degradations. Defaults to 'general_scenes'.
            
            super_resolution_factor: Factor by which the input image resolution should be increased. For instance, a factor of 4 will make the resolution 4 times greater in both height and width. Defaults to 4.
            
            disable_preprocess_model: Disables the initial preprocessing step using SwinIR. Turn this off if your input image is already of high quality and doesn't require restoration. Defaults to False.
            
            reload_restoration_model: Reload the image restoration model (SwinIR) if set to True. This can be useful if you've updated or changed the underlying SwinIR model. Defaults to False.
            
            background_upsampler_tile: For 'faces' mode: Size of each tile used by the background upsampler when dividing the image into patches. Defaults to 400.
            
            background_upsampler_tile_stride: For 'faces' mode: Distance between the start of each tile when the background is divided for upscaling. A smaller stride means more overlap between tiles. Defaults to 400.
