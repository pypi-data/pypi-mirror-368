        Args:
            protect: Control how much of the original vocals' breath and voiceless consonants to leave in the AI vocals. Set 0.5 to disable. Defaults to 0.33.
            
            f0_method: Pitch detection algorithm. 'rmvpe' for clarity in vocals, 'mangio-crepe' for smoother vocals. Defaults to 'rmvpe'.
            
            rvc_model: RVC model for a specific voice. If using a custom model, this should match the name of the downloaded model. If a 'custom_rvc_model_download_url' is provided, this will be automatically set to the name of the downloaded model. Defaults to 'Obama'.
            
            index_rate: Control how much of the AI's accent to leave in the vocals. Defaults to 0.5.
            
            pitch_change: Adjust pitch of AI vocals in semitones. Use positive values to increase pitch, negative to decrease. Defaults to 0.0.
            
            rms_mix_rate: Control how much to use the original vocal's loudness (0) or a fixed loudness (1). Defaults to 0.25.
            
            filter_radius: If >=3: apply median filtering to the harvested pitch results. Defaults to 3.
            
            output_format: wav for best quality and large file size, mp3 for decent quality and small file size. Defaults to 'mp3'.
            
            crepe_hop_length: When `f0_method` is set to `mangio-crepe`, this controls how often it checks for pitch changes in milliseconds. Defaults to 128.
            
            input_audio: Upload your audio file here. Optional.
            
            custom_rvc_model_download_url: URL to download a custom RVC model. If provided, the model will be downloaded (if it doesn't already exist) and used for prediction, regardless of the 'rvc_model' value. Optional.
