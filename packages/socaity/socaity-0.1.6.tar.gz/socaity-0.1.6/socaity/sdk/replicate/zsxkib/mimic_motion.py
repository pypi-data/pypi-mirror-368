        Args:
            motion_video: Reference video file containing the motion to be mimicked
            
            appearance_image: Reference image file for the appearance of the generated video
            
            chunk_size: Number of frames to generate in each processing chunk Defaults to 16.
            
            resolution: Height of the output video in pixels. Width is automatically calculated. Defaults to 576.
            
            sample_stride: Interval for sampling frames from the reference video. Higher values skip more frames. Defaults to 2.
            
            frames_overlap: Number of overlapping frames between chunks for smoother transitions Defaults to 6.
            
            guidance_scale: Strength of guidance towards the reference. Higher values adhere more closely to the reference but may reduce creativity. Defaults to 2.0.
            
            noise_strength: Strength of noise augmentation. Higher values add more variation but may reduce coherence with the reference. Defaults to 0.0.
            
            denoising_steps: Number of denoising steps in the diffusion process. More steps can improve quality but increase processing time. Defaults to 25.
            
            checkpoint_version: Choose the checkpoint version to use Defaults to 'v1-1'.
            
            output_frames_per_second: Frames per second of the output video. Affects playback speed. Defaults to 15.
            
            seed: Random seed. Leave blank to randomize the seed Optional.
