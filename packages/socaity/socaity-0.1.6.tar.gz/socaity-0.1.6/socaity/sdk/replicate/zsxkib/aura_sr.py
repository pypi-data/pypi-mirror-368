            max_batch_size: Controls the number of image tiles processed simultaneously. Higher values may increase speed but require more GPU memory. Lower values use less memory but may increase processing time. Default is 1 for broad compatibility. Adjust based on your GPU capabilities for optimal performance. Defaults to 1.
