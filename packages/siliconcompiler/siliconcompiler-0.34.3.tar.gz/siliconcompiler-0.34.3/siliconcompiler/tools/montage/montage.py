ImageMagickÂ® is a free and open-source software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster
image and vector image files.
It can read and write over 200 image file formats, and can support a wide range of image
manipulation operations, such as resizing, cropping, and color correction.
Use the montage program to create a composite image by combining several separate images.
The images are tiled on the composite image optionally adorned with a border, frame, image name,
and more
