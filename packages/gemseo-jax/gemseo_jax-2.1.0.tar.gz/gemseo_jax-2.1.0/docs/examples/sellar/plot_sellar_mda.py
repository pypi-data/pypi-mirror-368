# There are many options when combining JAXDisciplines for execution:
#   - JAXChain encapsulation:
#       This wraps a set of disciplines and executes as a single monolithic one.
#       Pros: Execution and compilation are faster.
#       Cons: Incompatible with MDANewtonRaphson.
#
#   - .compile_jit():
#       This compiles the function used to compute outputs and Jacobian.
#       Pros: Faster execution.
#       Cons: Compilation time can exceed total execution if function is called
#       only few times.
#   Note: Compilation itself does not takes place in this method, but only once a
#   jit-compiled function is executed, that is why we may add a pre-run.
#       - pre-run:
#           Executes the output and Jacobian function once to ensure compilation.
#           Pros: Ensures benchmarks include only execution times.
#           Cons: Compilation time is included in the 1st evaluation.

# %%
# # Conclusion
# Encapsulation with JAXChain (without JIT) allows for 1.4x speedup.
# JIT compilation allows for 1.8x speedup relative to un-jitted JAXChain and 2.6x
# relative to un-jitted separate disciplines.
# If compilation times are excluded from benchmark, these speedups are 2.2x and 3.2x,
# respectively.
