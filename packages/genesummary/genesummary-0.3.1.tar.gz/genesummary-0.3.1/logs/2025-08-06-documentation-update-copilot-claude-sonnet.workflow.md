# Documentation Update Workflow

**AI Model**: copilot-claude-sonnet
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Context**: README.md and documentation update for geneinfo package

## Objective

Update the main README.md and comprehensive documentation in `docs/` folder to accurately reflect the current state of the GeneInfo package with its modular fetcher architecture and advanced features.

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Codebase Assessment
- Examined project structure and identified modular fetcher architecture
- Analyzed available data sources and fetcher classes:
  - Genomic: EnsemblFetcher, MyGeneFetcher
  - Protein: UniProtFetcher, StringDBFetcher
  - Functional: GOFetcher, ReactomeFetcher
  - Clinical: ClinVarFetcher, GwasFetcher, OMIMFetcher
- Reviewed pyproject.toml for dependencies and configuration
- Identified advanced features like batch processing, rich CLI, concurrent workers

### 2. Documentation Gap Analysis
- Original README was basic and didn't reflect current capabilities
- Missing details on:
  - Modern Python 3.11+ requirements
  - Rich CLI interface with progress bars
  - Batch processing and performance characteristics
  - Clinical variant and GWAS data integration
  - Error handling and offline mode
  - Comprehensive API reference
