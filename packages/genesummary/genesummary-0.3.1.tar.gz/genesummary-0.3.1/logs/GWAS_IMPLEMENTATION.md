# GWAS Implementation Summary

## âœ… Successfully Implemented

The GWAS functionality has been successfully integrated into the geneinfo package:

### 1. **GwasFetcher Class** (in `geneinfo/fetchers.py`)
- Uses EBI GWAS Catalog REST API
- Retrieves SNPs associated with genes using `findByGene` endpoint
- Gets association data including p-values, effect sizes, and phenotypes
- Fetches EFO (Experimental Factor Ontology) traits for each association
- Rate-limited and error-handled API calls

### 2. **Core Integration** (in `geneinfo/core.py`)
- Added GwasFetcher to imports
- Initialized GwasFetcher in GeneInfo class
- Integrated GWAS data retrieval in `get_gene_info()` method
- GWAS data included in standard gene information output

### 3. **API Implementation Details**
- **Base URL**: `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/rest/api`
- **SNP Search**: `/singleNucleotidePolymorphisms/search/findByGene?geneName={gene}`
- **Associations**: `/singleNucleotidePolymorphisms/{rsId}/associations`
- **Traits**: Follows association links to get EFO trait information

### 4. **Output Structure**
```json
{
  "gwas": {
    "associations": [
      {
        "rsId": "rs386385565",
        "pvalue": 1.0E-17,
        "pvalueExponent": -17,
        "betaNum": 0.022206124,
        "betaDirection": "increase",
        "riskFrequency": "0.27965",
        "traits": [
          {
            "trait": "red cell distribution width",
            "uri": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0009188"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "total_snps": 412,
    "analyzed_snps": 10
  }
}
```

### 5. **Updated Status**
- **NOTE3.md** updated to reflect 82% completion (9/11 essential groups)
- Gene Model and TFBS marked as "NO NEED" per user request
- GWAS implementation completed and documented
- Only Phenotype/Disease associations remain as the major gap

## ðŸ§ª Testing

The implementation follows the same patterns as other fetchers in the package:
- Inherits from BaseFetcher for consistent error handling and rate limiting
- Uses `_make_request()` method for API calls
- Handles missing data gracefully
- Logs appropriate information during execution

## ðŸ“Š Impact

With GWAS implementation complete:
- geneinfo now covers 82% of AnimalTFDB4's essential data categories
- Provides comprehensive genetic variant-to-phenotype associations
- Supports GWAS-based research and clinical applications
- Only missing major feature is general disease/phenotype associations
