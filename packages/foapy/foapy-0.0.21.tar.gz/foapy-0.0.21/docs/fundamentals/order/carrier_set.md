# Carrier set

A _carrier set_ $X$ is a _set_ of all possible elements of a sequence

## Mathematical Definition

Let $X$ be a (possibly infinite) [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)).

## Examples

### Binary Sequence

A binary sequence `0110100110`

represented as

$X = \{0,1\}$

### Musical Chorus Sequence

A musical chorus for `Jingle bell rock`

```
D                Dmaj7        D6
Jingle-bell, Jingle-bell, Jingle-bell Rock.
  D                D#dim
Jingle-bell swing and
 Em           A7     Em               A7            Em A7
Jingle-bell ring. Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun.
Em  A9                  A7
Now the jingle-hop has begun.
```

$X = \{A7, A9, D, D6, Dmaj7, D\#dim, Em\}$

### DNA Sequence

A DNA sequence `ATGCTAGCATGCTAGCATGCTAGC`

$X = \{A,C,G,T\}$

### English Text Sequence as char sequence

An English text sentence `the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`

$X = \{\ ,a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z \}$

### English Text Sequence as word sequence

An English text sentence `the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`

$X = \{\ , brown, dog, quick, fox, lazy, over, the\}$
