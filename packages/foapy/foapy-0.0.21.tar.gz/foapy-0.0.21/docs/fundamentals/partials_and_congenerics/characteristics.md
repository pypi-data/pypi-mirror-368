# Characteristics for Partials

All [interval-based characteristics](../order/characteristics/index.md) are valid of _partials_ and _congenerics_.
The measures could be calculated based on [_Partial Intervals Chain_](./intervals_chain/index.md) or [_Partial Intervals Distribution_](./intervals_distribution.md) using the
relevant formulas for the characteristic. In case of using _Partial Intervals Chain_ pay attention that for partial $n$ is the number of _non-empty_ elements and differs from
tuple length $l$, while for _full_ sequences and their derivatives $n$ and $l$ are the same.
