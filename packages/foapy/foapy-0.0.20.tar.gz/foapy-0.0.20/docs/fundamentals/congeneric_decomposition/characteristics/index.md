# Characteristics

Applying any of [_interval-based characteristics_](../../order/characteristics/index.md) to each element of _Congenetric Itervals Distributions_ stack produce
a vector of the characteristic. These vectors could be useful in analyzing parts of the sequence.

In addition to that, there are four integral measures based on _congeneric intervals distributions_ that characterise the whole sequence

- [Identifying Information](./identifying_information.md)
- [Regularity](./regularity.md)
- [Uniformity](./uniformity.md)
