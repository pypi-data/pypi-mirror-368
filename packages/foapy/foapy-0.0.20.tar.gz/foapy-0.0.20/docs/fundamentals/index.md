# Fundamentals

Welcome to the Fundamentals section. Here, we introduce the core concepts and mathematical tools that underpin the Formal Order Analysis of sequences and their structure.

- [**Ideas**](./ideas/index.md): This section explores the foundational ideas, motivations, and principles behind Formal Order Analysis.

- [**Order and its measures**](./order/index.md): Learn about the concept of an Order in sequences, including how to quantify and characterize order using measures such as arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and related _interval-based_ characteristics.

- [**Partials and Congenerics**](./partials_and_congenerics/index.md): Discover conceptions of _Partial_ and _Congeneric_ sequences, its Order and other derivatives.

- [**Congeneric Decomposition**](./congeneric_decomposition/index.md): This section details the process and significance of breaking down sequences into congeneric components, providing a framework and measures for deeper structural analysis.

Each section builds on the previous, providing a comprehensive foundation for understanding and applying formal order analysis to a wide range of problems.
