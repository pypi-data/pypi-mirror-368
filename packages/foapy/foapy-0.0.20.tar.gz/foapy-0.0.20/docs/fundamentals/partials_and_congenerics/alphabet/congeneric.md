# Alphabet of Congeneric Sequence

[_Congenric sequence_](../sequence/congeneric.md#mathematical-definition) is defined on _Partial carrier set_ having only one _non-empty_ element.
That means that _Alphabet of Congeneric sequence_ is a tuple of one element. The alphabet power is 1.

## Mathematical Definition


Let $S_{c|e}$ is [_Congeneric Sequence of e element_](../sequence/congeneric.md#mathematical-definition)

Let $alphabet_p$ is [_Alphabet of Partial sequence_](../alphabet/index.md#mathematical-definition)

Then [_Alphabet_](../../order/alphabet.md#mathematical-definition)

$$A=alphabet_p(S_{c|e}) = <e>,$$

$$|A| = 1$$
