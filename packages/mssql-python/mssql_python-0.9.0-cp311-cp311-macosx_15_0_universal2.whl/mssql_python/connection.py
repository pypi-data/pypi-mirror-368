This module defines the Connection class, which is used to manage a connection to a database.
The class provides methods to establish a connection, create cursors, commit transactions, 
roll back transactions, and close the connection.
Resource Management:
- All cursors created from this connection are tracked internally.
- When close() is called on the connection, all open cursors are automatically closed.
- Do not use any cursor after the connection is closed; doing so will raise an exception.
- Cursors are also cleaned up automatically when no longer referenced, to prevent memory leaks.
