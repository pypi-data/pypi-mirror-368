# mssql-python

This is a new Python driver for Microsoft SQL Server currently in Alpha phase.

## Public Preview Release

We are making progress - The Public Preview of our driver is now available! This marks a significant milestone in our development journey. While we saw a few early adopters of our alpha release, we are introducing the following functionalities to support your applications in a more robust and reliable manner.

### What's Included:

- Everything from previous releases
- **Alpine Linux Support:** Added full support for Alpine Linux distribution (musllinux) with specialized driver handling and fixes for musl libc compatibility.
- **Connection Management Improvements:** Fixed autocommit to be False by default and added automatic rollback on connection close for better transaction control.
- **PyODBC Compatibility:** Enhanced type objects and constructor compatibility with pyodbc for seamless migration and interoperability.

For more information, please visit the project link on Github: https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-python

### What's Next:

As we continue to develop and refine the driver, you can expect regular updates that will introduce new features, optimizations, and bug fixes. We encourage you to contribute, provide feedback and report any issues you encounter, as this will help us improve the driver for the final release.

### Stay Tuned:

We appreciate your interest and support in this project. Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements as we work towards delivering a robust and fully-featured driver in coming months.
Thank you for being a part of our journey!
