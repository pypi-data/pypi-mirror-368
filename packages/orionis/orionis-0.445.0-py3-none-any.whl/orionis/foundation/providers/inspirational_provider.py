class InspirationalProvider(ServiceProvider):
    """
    Provides and registers the inspirational service within the application container.

    This provider is responsible for determining and registering the appropriate
    implementation of the inspirational service. It ensures that the service is
    available for dependency injection throughout the application by binding the
    `IInspire` contract to its concrete implementation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    app : Application
        The application container instance where services are registered.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        This class does not return a value; it registers services within the container.

    def register(self) -> None:
        """
        Registers the inspirational service in the application container.

        This method binds the `IInspire` contract to its concrete implementation `Inspire`
        as a transient service within the application's service container. The service is
        also registered with the alias "core.orionis.inspire" to allow for convenient
        resolution elsewhere in the application.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return a value. It performs service registration as a side effect.

    def boot(self) -> None:
        """
        Executes post-registration initialization for the inspirational service.

        This method is intended for any setup or initialization logic that should
        occur after the inspirational service has been registered in the application
        container. By default, it does nothing, but it can be overridden in subclasses
        to perform additional configuration or resource allocation as needed.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It is intended for side effects only.
