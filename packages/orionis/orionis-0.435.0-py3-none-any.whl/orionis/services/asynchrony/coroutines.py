        ----------
        func : Coroutine
            The coroutine object to be wrapped. Must be an awaitable coroutine.

        Raises
        ------

        -------
        T or asyncio.Future
            If called outside an event loop, returns the result of the coroutine after synchronous execution.
            If called within an event loop, returns an asyncio.Future representing the scheduled coroutine.

        Raises
        ------
        RuntimeError
            If the coroutine cannot be executed due to event loop issues.

        Notes
        -----
        - When invoked outside an active event loop, the coroutine is executed synchronously and its result is returned.
        - When invoked inside an active event loop, the coroutine is scheduled for asynchronous execution and a Future is returned.
        - This method automatically detects the execution context and chooses the appropriate execution strategy.
