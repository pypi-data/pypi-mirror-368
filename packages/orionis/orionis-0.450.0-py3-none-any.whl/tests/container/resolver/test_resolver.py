        Validates the implementation and structure of the `Resolver` class.

        This test checks that the `Resolver` class:
            - Implements all required methods.
            - Inherits from the `IResolver` interface.
            - Has main public methods (`resolve`, `resolveType`, `resolveSignature`) that are synchronous.

        Parameters
        ----------
        self : TestResolverMethods
            The test case instance.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            The method does not return any value. Assertions are used to validate the class structure.
