    Represents the dependencies of a class, distinguishing between resolved and unresolved dependencies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resolved : dict of KnownDependency to Any
        Dictionary mapping KnownDependency instances to their resolved values or instances.
    unresolved : list of str
        List of dependency names or identifiers that could not be resolved.

    Attributes
    ----------
    resolved : dict of KnownDependency to Any
        The resolved dependencies for the class.
    unresolved : list of str
        The unresolved dependency names or identifiers.

    Raises
    ------
    ReflectionTypeError
        If 'resolved' is not a dictionary with KnownDependency keys or 'unresolved' is not a list.
    ValueError
        If 'resolved' contains None keys or 'unresolved' contains empty strings.
