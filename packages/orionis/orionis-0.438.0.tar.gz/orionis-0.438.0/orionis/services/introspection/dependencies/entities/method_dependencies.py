    """
    Represents the dependencies of a method, distinguishing between resolved and unresolved dependencies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resolved : dict of KnownDependency to Any
        Dictionary mapping each resolved KnownDependency to its corresponding instance or value.
    unresolved : list of str
        List of parameter names or dependency identifiers that could not be resolved.

    Raises
    ------
    ReflectionTypeError
        If `resolved` is not a dictionary with KnownDependency keys, or if `unresolved` is not a list of strings.
    ValueError
        If `resolved` contains None keys or `unresolved` contains empty strings.

    Attributes
    ----------
    resolved : dict of KnownDependency to Any
        The resolved dependencies for the method.
    unresolved : list of str
        The unresolved dependencies for the method.
