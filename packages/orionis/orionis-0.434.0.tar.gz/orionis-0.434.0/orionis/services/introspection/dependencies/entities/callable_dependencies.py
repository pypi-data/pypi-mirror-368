    """
    Represents the dependencies of a callable, separating resolved and unresolved dependencies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resolved : Dict[KnownDependency, Any]
        A dictionary mapping resolved dependency descriptors to their corresponding
        resolved instances or values for the method. All keys must be KnownDependency instances.
    unresolved : List[str]
        A list of method parameter names or dependency identifiers that could not be resolved.
        Must contain only non-empty strings.

    Raises
    ------
    ReflectionTypeError
        If types don't match the expected:
            - resolved: Dict[KnownDependency, Any]
            - unresolved: List[str]
