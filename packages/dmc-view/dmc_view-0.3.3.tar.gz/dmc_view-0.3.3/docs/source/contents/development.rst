Developer Guide
===============

| Insall `pip` 
 
.. code-block:: shell

    python3 -m pip install 


| Clone the repository 

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone git@github.com:Issamricin/dmc-view.git
    cd dmc-view

| Make the project in edit mode  

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install -e .


Publish Notes
-------------
Steps to test the publish on pypi see workflow files for publish on pypi test server (release_test.yaml)

| If you do update for the README.rst , please copy and paste into  `RST-Check <https://rsted.info.ucl.ac.be/>`__ 

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone git@github.com:Issamricin/dmc-view.git
   python -m venv .venv 


You need to install tox on to run the workflow tox task or env run task 

| **TODO: below tox env run needs to completed**

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m pip install tox 

| Below is to build and check the twine for pypi publish in case an error in the markup you need to check rst online 

 `Making Friendly PyPi Package  <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/making-a-pypi-friendly-readme/>`__ 

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m build -s
   python -m build --wheel
   python -m pip install --upgrade twine
   twine check dist/* 
    
 
Now you need to have your test project setup on testpypi 
`Publishing <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/>`__ 
so to trigger the workflow you need to create a test tag and push it so it triggers the release_test.yaml
Before you do that update your package version in the toml, tox and __init__.py file

| **TODO: Iso you need to find a way to make all from one place**
| suppose my package release is 0.3.3 
| Test tag  is **test-0.3.3**
| Prod tag is **release-0.3.3**

| To trigger the release into test pypi  
| $  git tag test-0.3.3
| $  git push origin  --tags

Developer Notes
---------------
Testing, Documentation Building, Scripts, CI/CD, Static Code Analysis for this project.

1. **Test Suite**, using `pytest`_, located in `tests` dir
2. **Parallel Execution** of Unit Tests, on multiple cpu's
3. **Documentation Pages**, hosted on `readthedocs` server, located in `docs` dir
4. **CI(Continuous Integration)/CD(Continuous Delivery) Pipeline**, running on `Github Actions`, defined in `.github/`

   a. **Test Job Matrix**, spanning different `platform`'s and `python version`'s

      1. Platforms: `ubuntu-latest`
      2. Python Interpreters:  `3.13`
   b. **Continuous Deployment**
   
      `Production`
      
         1. **Python Distristribution** to `pypi.org`_, on `tags` **v***, pushed to `main` branch
         2. **Docker Image** to `Dockerhub`_, on every push, with automatic `Image Tagging`
      
      `Staging`

         3. **Python Distristribution** to `test.pypi.org`_, on "pre-release" `tags` **v*-rc**, pushed to `release` branch

   c. **Configurable Policies** for `Docker`, and `Static Code Analysis` Workflows
5. **Automation**, using `tox`_, driven by single `tox.ini` file

   a. **Code Coverage** measuring
   b. **Build Command**, using the `build`_ python package
   c. **Pypi Deploy Command**, supporting upload to both `pypi.org`_ and `test.pypi.org`_ servers
   d. **Type Check Command**, using `mypy`_
   e. **Lint** *Check* and `Apply` commands, using the fast `Ruff`_ linter, along with `isort`_ and `black`_


Prerequisites
-------------

You need to have `Python` and  `PySide6`  installed for Development
