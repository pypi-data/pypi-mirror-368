# Introduction

`pylocc` is a command-line tool for counting lines of code in various programming languages. It helps you get a quick overview of the size and composition of your codebase.

This project draws inspiration from [scc](https://github.com/boyter/scc) and uses the same language.json file.

## Features

*   Counts lines of code, comments, and blank lines.
*   Supports a wide range of programming languages.
*   Can process single files or entire directories.
*   Provides both aggregated and per-file reports.
*   Easy to use and configure.
