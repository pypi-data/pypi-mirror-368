# A python module using `libadapta`

This is the `PyPI` readme. Included commands can be used for effect. Add
any commands to the `pyproject.toml` in the source linked below.

Are you sure you've changed any `xapp_adapta` references to be unique?
Please check `pyproject.toml` and also rename the module directory from
`xapp_adapta`. Also check that `_` is not `-`.

Included commands (add more):

- `xapp_adapta_test` the basic original python demo of `libadapta`. Added a try catch
  to make `àdwaita` be used instead if `àdapta` is not present.

Thanks
