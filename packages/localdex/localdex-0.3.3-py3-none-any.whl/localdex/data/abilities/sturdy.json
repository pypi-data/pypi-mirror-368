  "description": "When this Pokémon is at full HP, any hit that would knock it out will instead leave it with 1 HP.  Regardless of its current HP, it is also immune to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold.  If this Pokémon is holding a focus sash, this ability takes precedence and the item will not be consumed.",
