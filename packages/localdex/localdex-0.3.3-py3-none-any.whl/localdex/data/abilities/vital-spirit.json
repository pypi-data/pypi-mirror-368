  "description": "This Pokémon cannot be asleep.  This causes rest to fail altogether.  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.  This ability functions identically to insomnia in battle.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased.",
