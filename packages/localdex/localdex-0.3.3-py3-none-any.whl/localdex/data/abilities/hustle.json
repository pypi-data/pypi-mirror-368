  "description": "This Pokémon's physical moves do 1.5× as much regular damage, but have 0.8× their usual accuracy.  Special moves are unaffected.  Moves that do set damage, such as seismic toss, have their accuracy affected, but not their damage.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased.",
