  "description": "Whenever an electric-type move hits this Pokémon, it heals for 1/4 of its maximum HP, negating any other effect on it.  This ability will not take effect if this Pokémon is ground-type and thus immune to Electric moves.  Electric moves will ignore this Pokémon's substitute.  This effect includes non-damaging moves, i.e. thunder wave.",
