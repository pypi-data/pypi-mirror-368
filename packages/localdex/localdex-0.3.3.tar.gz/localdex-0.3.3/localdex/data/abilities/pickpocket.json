  "description": "Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, if it does not have a held item, it steals the attacker's held item.  This Pokémon cannot steal upon being knocked out.  It can steal if the attacker has a substitute, but cannot steal when its own Substitute is hit.  If a move hits multiple times, only the last hit triggers this ability.  If this Pokémon is wild, it cannot steal from a trained Pokémon.",
