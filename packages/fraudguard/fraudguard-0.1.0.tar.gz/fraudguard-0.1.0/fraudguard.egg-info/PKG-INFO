FraudGuard provides modular, scalable tools for detecting financial fraud with machine learning. Built specifically for financial institutions, it offers pre-built feature extractors, production-optimized models, and end-to-end fraud detection pipelines that can be deployed in real-time environments.

✨ Key Features
🔧 Modular Architecture: Mix and match feature extractors, models, and pipeline components

⚡ Production-Ready: Sub-100ms inference with enterprise-grade scalability

🧠 Financial Domain Expertise: Pre-built features optimized for fraud detection

📊 Advanced Models: XGBoost, Random Forest, Ensembles, and Anomaly Detection

🔍 Explainable AI: Built-in SHAP integration for regulatory compliance

⚖️ Class Imbalance Handling: Automatic techniques for imbalanced fraud datasets

📈 Fraud-Specific Metrics: Precision at K%, false alert rates, financial impact analysis

🚀 Real-time API: FastAPI-based REST API for live fraud scoring

🚀 Quick Start
python
from fraudguard import FraudDetectionPipeline
from fraudguard.features import TransactionFeatures, BehavioralFeatures
from fraudguard.models import XGBoostModel

# Create feature pipeline
features = TransactionFeatures() + BehavioralFeatures()

# Initialize model
model = XGBoostModel()

# Create detection pipeline
pipeline = FraudDetectionPipeline(features=features, model=model)

# Train on your data
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Detect fraud
fraud_scores = pipeline.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # Get fraud probabilities
predictions = pipeline.predict(X_test)  # Get binary predictions

# Score new transactions
risk_scores = pipeline.score_transactions(X_new, return_details=True)
print(f"High-risk transactions: {(fraud_scores > 0.7).sum()}")

🎯 Use Cases
FraudGuard is designed for various financial fraud detection scenarios:

Use Case	Description	Key Features
Credit Card Fraud	Detect unauthorized card transactions	Transaction velocity, amount patterns, merchant analysis
Digital Payment Fraud	Monitor online payment fraud	Device fingerprinting, behavioral analysis, velocity checks
Account Takeover	Identify compromised user accounts	Login patterns, geographic anomalies, behavior changes
Synthetic Identity	Detect artificially created identities	Identity verification, network analysis, behavioral profiling
Money Laundering	Flag suspicious financial patterns	Transaction flows, network analysis, compliance reporting
🏗️ Architecture
FraudGuard follows a modular architecture with distinct components:

🛠️ Advanced Usage
Custom Feature Engineering
python
from fraudguard.features import BaseFeatureExtractor

class CustomFeatures(BaseFeatureExtractor):
    def extract_features(self, data):
        features = {}
        # Your custom feature logic
        features['custom_risk_score'] = self._calculate_risk(data)
        return pd.DataFrame(features, index=data.index)

# Use in pipeline
custom_features = CustomFeatures()
pipeline = FraudDetectionPipeline(
    features=TransactionFeatures() + custom_features,
    model=XGBoostModel()
)
Model Ensembles
python
from fraudguard.models import EnsembleModel, XGBoostModel, RandomForestModel

# Create ensemble
ensemble = EnsembleModel([
    XGBoostModel(n_estimators=100),
    RandomForestModel(n_estimators=200)
], ensemble_method='voting')

pipeline = FraudDetectionPipeline(model=ensemble)
Real-time Fraud Scoring API
python
from fraudguard.deployment import FraudGuardAPIServer

# Deploy trained pipeline as REST API
api_server = FraudGuardAPIServer(pipeline)
api_server.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)

# Make predictions via HTTP
# POST /predict/ with transaction data
# Returns: {"fraud_score": 0.85, "is_fraud": 1}
Batch Processing
python
from fraudguard.deployment import BatchFraudProcessor

# Process large datasets
batch_processor = BatchFraudProcessor(pipeline)
results = batch_processor.score_file('transactions.csv', 'results.csv')
📊 Performance Metrics
FraudGuard provides comprehensive fraud-specific metrics:

python
from fraudguard.utils import FraudMetrics

metrics = FraudMetrics()
evaluation = metrics.calculate_all_metrics(y_true, y_pred, y_scores)

# Key metrics include:
# - AUC-ROC and AUC-PR
# - Precision at K% (1%, 5%, 10%)  
# - False Alert Rate
# - Financial Impact Analysis
# - Confusion Matrix Details

print(f"Precision at 5%: {evaluation['precision_at_5_percent']:.3f}")
print(f"False Alert Rate: {evaluation['false_alert_rate']:.3f}")
🔍 Model Interpretability
Built-in explainable AI for regulatory compliance:

python
# Get feature importance
importance = pipeline.get_feature_importance()

# Generate SHAP explanations (requires shap package)
import shap
explainer = shap.Explainer(pipeline.model.model)
shap_values = explainer(X_test)
shap.plots.waterfall(shap_values[0])
📋 Requirements
Python: 3.8+

Core Dependencies: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost

Optional: shap (explainability), fastapi (API deployment)

System: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

📈 Performance Benchmarks
