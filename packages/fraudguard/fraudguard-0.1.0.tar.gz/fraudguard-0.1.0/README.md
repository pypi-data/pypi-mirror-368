🚀 Real-time API: FastAPI-based REST API for live fraud scoring

🚀 Quick Start
python
from fraudguard import FraudDetectionPipeline
from fraudguard.features import TransactionFeatures, BehavioralFeatures
from fraudguard.models import XGBoostModel

# Create feature pipeline
features = TransactionFeatures() + BehavioralFeatures()

# Initialize model
model = XGBoostModel()

# Create detection pipeline
pipeline = FraudDetectionPipeline(features=features, model=model)

# Train on your data
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Detect fraud
fraud_scores = pipeline.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # Get fraud probabilities
predictions = pipeline.predict(X_test)  # Get binary predictions

# Score new transactions
risk_scores = pipeline.score_transactions(X_new, return_details=True)
print(f"High-risk transactions: {(fraud_scores > 0.7).sum()}")

🛠️ Advanced Usage
Custom Feature Engineering
python
from fraudguard.features import BaseFeatureExtractor

class CustomFeatures(BaseFeatureExtractor):
    def extract_features(self, data):
        features = {}
        # Your custom feature logic
        features['custom_risk_score'] = self._calculate_risk(data)
        return pd.DataFrame(features, index=data.index)

# Use in pipeline
custom_features = CustomFeatures()
pipeline = FraudDetectionPipeline(
    features=TransactionFeatures() + custom_features,
    model=XGBoostModel()
)
Model Ensembles
python
from fraudguard.models import EnsembleModel, XGBoostModel, RandomForestModel

# Create ensemble
ensemble = EnsembleModel([
    XGBoostModel(n_estimators=100),
    RandomForestModel(n_estimators=200)
], ensemble_method='voting')

pipeline = FraudDetectionPipeline(model=ensemble)
Real-time Fraud Scoring API
python
from fraudguard.deployment import FraudGuardAPIServer

# Deploy trained pipeline as REST API
api_server = FraudGuardAPIServer(pipeline)
api_server.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)

# Make predictions via HTTP
# POST /predict/ with transaction data
# Returns: {"fraud_score": 0.85, "is_fraud": 1}
Batch Processing
python
from fraudguard.deployment import BatchFraudProcessor

# Process large datasets
batch_processor = BatchFraudProcessor(pipeline)
results = batch_processor.score_file('transactions.csv', 'results.csv')
📊 Performance Metrics
FraudGuard provides comprehensive fraud-specific metrics:

python
from fraudguard.utils import FraudMetrics

metrics = FraudMetrics()
evaluation = metrics.calculate_all_metrics(y_true, y_pred, y_scores)

# Key metrics include:
# - AUC-ROC and AUC-PR
# - Precision at K% (1%, 5%, 10%)  
# - False Alert Rate
# - Financial Impact Analysis
# - Confusion Matrix Details

print(f"Precision at 5%: {evaluation['precision_at_5_percent']:.3f}")
print(f"False Alert Rate: {evaluation['false_alert_rate']:.3f}")
🔍 Model Interpretability
Built-in explainable AI for regulatory compliance:

python
# Get feature importance
importance = pipeline.get_feature_importance()

# Generate SHAP explanations (requires shap package)
import shap
explainer = shap.Explainer(pipeline.model.model)
shap_values = explainer(X_test)
shap.plots.waterfall(shap_values[0])
📋 Requirements
Python: 3.8+

Core Dependencies: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost

Optional: shap (explainability), fastapi (API deployment)

System: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
