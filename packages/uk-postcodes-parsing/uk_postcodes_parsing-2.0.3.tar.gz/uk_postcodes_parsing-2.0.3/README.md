**Extract UK postcodes from text and get rich geographic data.** The only Python library that combines intelligent text parsing with comprehensive postcode database lookup.

Perfect for **document processing**, **OCR applications**, **address validation**, and **location services**.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install uk-postcodes-parsing
```

**30-second example** - Extract postcodes from text and get enhanced data:

```python
import uk_postcodes_parsing as ukp

# Extract postcodes from any text (emails, documents, OCR results)
text = "Please send the report to our London office at SW1A 1AA or Manchester at M1 1AD"
postcodes = ukp.parse_from_corpus(text)

# Get rich geographic data for each postcode found
for pc in postcodes:
    enhanced = ukp.lookup_postcode(pc.postcode)
    if enhanced:
        print(f"{pc.postcode}: {enhanced.district}, {enhanced.region}")
        print(f"  📍 {enhanced.latitude:.3f}, {enhanced.longitude:.3f}")
        print(f"  🏛️ {enhanced.constituency}")

# Output:
# SW1A 1AA: Westminster, London
#   📍 51.501, -0.142
#   🏛️ Cities of London and Westminster
# M1 1AD: Manchester, North West  
#   📍 53.484, -2.245
#   🏛️ Manchester Central
```

## Installation & Setup

```bash
pip install uk-postcodes-parsing
```

The postcode database (~796MB) downloads automatically on first use:

**Storage Locations:**
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\uk_postcodes_parsing\postcodes.db`
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.uk_postcodes_parsing/postcodes.db`

**Using Custom Database:**
```python
# Use a locally-built database instead of downloading
ukp.setup_database(local_db_path='/path/to/your/postcodes.db')

# Or set environment variable
export UK_POSTCODES_DB_PATH=/path/to/your/postcodes.db
```

## Usage Examples

### 🔍 Text Parsing → Enhanced Lookup (Complete Workflow)

The most powerful feature - extract postcodes from messy text and get rich data:

```python
import uk_postcodes_parsing as ukp

# Real-world example: Extract from email/document
document = """
Dear Customer,

Your orders will be shipped to:
- London Office: SW1A 1AA (next to Big Ben)  
- Manchester Branch: M1 1AD
- Edinburgh Office: EH1 1AD (city center)

For OCR'd text with errors: "Please send to SW1A OAA" (O instead of 0)
"""

# Extract all postcodes
postcodes = ukp.parse_from_corpus(document, attempt_fix=True)
print(f"Found {len(postcodes)} postcodes:\n")

# Get comprehensive data for each
for pc in postcodes:
    enhanced = ukp.lookup_postcode(pc.postcode)
    if enhanced:
        print(f"🏠 {pc.postcode}")
        print(f"   📍 Location: {enhanced.district}, {enhanced.region}")
        print(f"   🗺️ Coordinates: {enhanced.latitude:.3f}, {enhanced.longitude:.3f}")
        print(f"   🏛️ Constituency: {enhanced.constituency}")
        print(f"   🏥 Healthcare: {enhanced.healthcare_region}")
        if pc.fix_distance < 0:  # Was corrected
            print(f"   ⚠️  Fixed from: {pc.original}")
        print()
```

### 🗺️ Direct Postcode Lookup

Get comprehensive data for known postcodes:

```python
import uk_postcodes_parsing as ukp

result = ukp.lookup_postcode("SW1A 1AA")
if result:
    print(f"Postcode: {result.postcode}")
    print(f"Coordinates: {result.latitude}, {result.longitude}")  
    print(f"District: {result.district}")
    print(f"County: {result.county}")
    print(f"Region: {result.region}")
    print(f"Country: {result.country}")
    print(f"Constituency: {result.constituency}")
    print(f"Healthcare Region: {result.healthcare_region}")

# Convert to dictionary for APIs/JSON
data = result.to_dict()
print(f"API Response: {data}")
```

### 📍 Spatial Queries & Distance

Find postcodes near coordinates or other postcodes:

```python
import uk_postcodes_parsing as ukp

# Find nearest postcodes to coordinates (e.g., GPS location)
lat, lon = 51.5014, -0.1419  # Parliament Square, London
nearest = ukp.find_nearest(lat, lon, radius_km=1, limit=5)

print("Nearest postcodes:")
for postcode, distance in nearest:
    print(f"{postcode.postcode}: {distance:.2f}km - {postcode.district}")

# Reverse geocoding - coordinates to postcode  
postcode = ukp.reverse_geocode(lat, lon)
print(f"Closest postcode: {postcode.postcode}")

# Distance between postcodes
london = ukp.lookup_postcode("SW1A 1AA")  # Parliament
edinburgh = ukp.lookup_postcode("EH16 5AY")  # Edinburgh city center
if london and edinburgh:
    distance = london.distance_to(edinburgh)
    print(f"London to Edinburgh: {distance:.1f}km")
```

### 🔎 Search & Area Queries

Search and filter postcodes by various criteria:

```python
import uk_postcodes_parsing as ukp

# Search postcodes by prefix
results = ukp.search_postcodes("SW1A", limit=5)
print(f"Found {len(results)} postcodes starting with SW1A")

# Get all postcodes in administrative areas
westminster = ukp.get_area_postcodes("district", "Westminster", limit=1000000)
print(f"Westminster district has {len(westminster)} postcodes")

# Search by constituency
constituency = ukp.get_area_postcodes("constituency", "Cities of London and Westminster")
print(f"Constituency has {len(constituency)} postcodes")

# Get all postcodes in a specific outcode
sw1a_postcodes = ukp.get_outcode_postcodes("SW1A")
print(f"SW1A outcode has {len(sw1a_postcodes)} postcodes")
```

### 🛠️ OCR Error Correction & Text Processing

Advanced text processing for OCR and document digitization:

```python
import uk_postcodes_parsing as ukp

# OCR often confuses similar characters
ocr_text = "Contact office at SW1A OAA or try EH16 50Y for Scotland"

# Parse with error correction
postcodes = ukp.parse_from_corpus(ocr_text, attempt_fix=True)

for pc in postcodes:
    print(f"Original: '{pc.original}'")
    print(f"Corrected: '{pc.postcode}'")
    print(f"Confidence: {pc.fix_distance} (0=perfect, negative=corrected)")
    print(f"Valid: {pc.is_in_ons_postcode_directory}")
    print()

# For uncertain cases, get all possible corrections
uncertain_text = "OOO 4SS"  # Multiple possible fixes
all_options = ukp.parse_from_corpus(
    uncertain_text, 
    attempt_fix=True, 
    try_all_fix_options=True
)

print(f"Possible corrections for '{uncertain_text}':")
for option in all_options:
    print(f"  {option.postcode} (confidence: {option.fix_distance})")
```

### 📊 Database Management & Info

Control database setup and get statistics:

```python
import uk_postcodes_parsing as ukp

# Get database information
info = ukp.get_database_info()
print(f"Database has {info['record_count']:,} postcodes")
print(f"Database size: {info['size_mb']:.1f} MB") 
print(f"Source: {info['metadata']['source_date']}")

# Explicit database setup (usually automatic)
success = ukp.setup_database()
if success:
    print("Database ready!")

# Force redownload if needed (rare)
ukp.setup_database(force_redownload=True)

# Get detailed statistics
from uk_postcodes_parsing.postcode_database import PostcodeDatabase
db = PostcodeDatabase()
stats = db.get_statistics()

print(f"Total postcodes: {stats['total_postcodes']:,}")
print(f"With coordinates: {stats['with_coordinates']:,}")
print(f"Coverage: {stats['coordinate_coverage_percent']}%")
print(f"Countries: {stats['countries']}")
```

## Complete API Reference

### Text Parsing Functions
```python
# Extract postcodes from text
postcodes = ukp.parse_from_corpus(text, attempt_fix=False, try_all_fix_options=False)

# Parse single postcode  
postcode = ukp.parse(postcode_string, attempt_fix=False)

# Check if postcode is valid
is_valid = ukp.is_in_ons_postcode_directory(postcode_string)
```

```python
# Get comprehensive postcode data
result = ukp.lookup_postcode(postcode_string)  # Returns PostcodeResult or None

# Search by prefix
results = ukp.search_postcodes(query, limit=10)  # Returns List[PostcodeResult]

# Get postcodes in administrative areas
results = ukp.get_area_postcodes(area_type, area_value, limit=None)
# area_type: "district", "constituency", "region", "country", etc.
```

## Data Fields

Each `PostcodeResult` contains 25+ fields:

**Geographic:**
- `latitude`, `longitude` (99.3% coverage)
- `eastings`, `northings` (British National Grid)

**Administrative:**  
- `district`, `county`, `region`, `country`
- `ward`, `parish`, `constituency`

**Healthcare:**
- `healthcare_region`, `nhs_health_authority`

**Statistical:**
- `lower_output_area`, `middle_output_area`

**Postal:**
- `postcode`, `incode`, `outcode`

See full field list in API documentation.

## Advanced Features

### Performance & Threading
- **Thread-safe**: Use from multiple threads safely
- **Connection pooling**: Efficient database access
- **Caching**: Outcode queries cached for performance

### Error Handling
- **Graceful fallback**: Falls back to Python set if database unavailable (for parsing capability only)  

## Migration from v1.x

v2.0 is **100% backward compatible**. All existing code continues to work unchanged.

**New capabilities** (use these for new code):
```python
# v2.0 - Recommended import pattern
import uk_postcodes_parsing as ukp

# All functions available at top level
postcodes = ukp.parse_from_corpus(text)
result = ukp.lookup_postcode("SW1A 1AA") 
nearest = ukp.find_nearest(51.5, -0.14)
```

**Legacy imports** (still work):
```python  
# v1.x - Still supported
from uk_postcodes_parsing import ukpostcode
from uk_postcodes_parsing.fix import fix
```
