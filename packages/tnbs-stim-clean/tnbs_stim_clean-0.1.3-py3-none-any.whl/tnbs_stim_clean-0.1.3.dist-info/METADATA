# tnbs_stim_clean

## Description
`tnbs_stim_clean` provides functionality to clean EEG, MEG, and other time-series data from mne-python by removing unwanted stimuli using the tnbs_stim_clean function. This is especially useful in preprocessing to remove noise or artifacts from signals caused by stimuli events.

## Installation

You can install the package via pip from PyPI:

```bash
pip install tnbs_stim_clean
```
## Example use

```bash
import tnbs_stim_clean

# Example parameters
raw  # Raw time series data in MNE's raw object format
half_win = 100  # Half window size around each stimulus (in samples) that will be chopped away from the artifact peak point
threshold = 0.0001  # Threshold above which stimulus is considered significant

# Apply stimulus cleaning 
raw_cleaned = tnbs_stim_clean(raw, half_win, threshold)
```
