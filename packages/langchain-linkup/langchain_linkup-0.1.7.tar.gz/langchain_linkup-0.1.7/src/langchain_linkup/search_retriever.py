class LinkupSearchRetriever(BaseRetriever):
    """LinkupSearchRetriever retriever.

    The LinkupSearchRetriever uses the Linkup API search entrypoint, making possible to retrieve
    documents from the Linkup API sources, that is the web and the Linkup Premium Partner sources,
    using natural language.

    Setup:
        Install ``langchain_linkup`` and set environment variable ``LINKUP_API_KEY``.

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip install -U langchain_linkup
            export LINKUP_API_KEY="your-api-key"

    Key init args:
        depth: Literal["standard", "deep"]
            The depth of the Linkup search. Can be either "standard", for a straighforward and fast
            search, or "deep" for a more powerful agentic workflow.
        linkup_api_key: Optional[str] = None
            The API key for the Linkup API. If None (the default), the API key will be read from
            the environment variable `LINKUP_API_KEY`.
        from_date: Optional[date] = None
            The start date for the search in datetime.date object.
        to_date: Optional[date] = None
            The end date for the search in datetime.date object.
        include_domains: Optional[list[str]] = None
            The list of domains to search on (only those domains).
        exclude_domains: Optional[list[str]] = None
            The list of domains to exclude from the search.
        include_image: bool = False
            If set to True, image results will be included alongside text results.

    Instantiate:
        .. code-block:: python

            from langchain_linkup import LinkupSearchRetriever

            retriever = LinkupSearchRetriever(

                linkup_api_key=None,
            )

    Usage:
        .. code-block:: python

            query = "Who won the latest US presidential elections?"

            retriever.invoke(query)
