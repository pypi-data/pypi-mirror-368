           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# ZPimp: Zeppelin Python Notebook Importer

A simple Python library to import and execute Python code from one Apache Zeppelin notebook into another.

## The Problem

Apache Zeppelin notebooks often require shared configurations, constants, or utility functions across multiple notes. Copy-pasting code between them leads to duplication, potential errors, and maintenance headaches. `ZPimp` addresses this by allowing you to define common Python code in a central "library" notebook and easily import and execute it in other notebooks, promoting DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles within your Zeppelin environment.

## Features

* utility functions acroImport notebooks using a simple path prefix (e.g., `Utils/config`) without needing the full filename including the Zeppelin-generated ID.
*o another.

## The ProblemThe library automatically finds the correct
A simplefile in the target directory based on the provided prefix.
*library to import and exeIf multiple notebooks match the prefix, it raises ae Python libralisting the conflicting files and guiding the user to provide a more specific path (including the ID).
*om one Apache Zeppelin noteRaisesp: Zeppelin Python Noif the target directory or notebook cannot be located.
*hon library to import and exeAutomatically finds and extracts code only from paragraphs identified as Python (e.g., starting withe from one # ZPimp: Zeppelin  `%flink.pyflink`).
*hon Notebook Importer

A simple PytExecutes the imported code within theorter

A simpscope of the calling notebook's paragraph, making functions and variables immediately available.

## Installation

```bash
pip install zpimp
```

# Usage
Imagine you have a shared notebook located at /notebook/Libraries/main_config_ABC123XYZ.zpln (where /notebook is Zeppelin's base notebook directory). Inside this notebook, you have a Python paragraph (%python):

```python
# Content of a %python paragraph in Libraries/main_config_ABC123XYZ.zpln
print("Executing shared config code...")

MY_CONFIG_VALUE = "some_secret_value"
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 60

def common_utility_function(x):
  """A simple shared utility function."""
  return x * x

print("Shared config loaded.")
Now, in another notebook where you want to use this configuration or function:
```


```python
%python
# In your main Zeppelin notebook where you want to use the shared code

# Import the core function from the library
from zpimp import import_note

# Specify the path prefix to the notebook RELATIVE to Zeppelin's base notebook directory
# e.g., If the target is /notebook/Libraries/main_config_ABC123XYZ.zpln
# and the base dir is /notebook, the prefix is "Libraries/main_config"
notebook_prefix = "Libraries/main_config"

# Specify the absolute base directory where Zeppelin stores notebooks
# (Important: Ensure this path is correct for your setup!)
zeppelin_notebook_base_dir = "/notebook" # Or "/zeppelin/notebook", "/opt/zeppelin/notebook", etc.

print(f"Attempting to import notebook: '{notebook_prefix}'")

# Execute the import
# Pass the prefix and the base directory
import_successful = import_note(
    notebook_path_prefix=notebook_prefix,
    base_dir=zeppelin_notebook_base_dir
)

if import_successful:
    print("Import successful!")
    # Now, variables and functions from 'main_config' are available directly
    try:
        print(f"Config value: {MY_CONFIG_VALUE}")
        print(f"Default timeout: {DEFAULT_TIMEOUT}")
        result = common_utility_function(5)
        print(f"Utility function result: {result}")
    except NameError as e:
        print(f"Error accessing imported variable/function: {e}")
else:
    print("Import failed. Check logs above for details.")
```

# Function Arguments
The import_note function takes the following arguments:
 • notebook_path_prefix (str): Required. The path to the target notebook, relative to base_dir, without the _NOTEBOOKID.zpln suffix. Example: "MyFolder/SubFolder/MyNotebook".
 • base_dir (str): Required. The absolute path to the root directory where Apache Zeppelin stores its notebook folders.
Example: "/path/to/zeppelin/notebook". Ensure this path is correct for your installation!
Error Handling
 • FileNotFoundError: Raised if the base_dir or a subdirectory specified in the notebook_path_prefix does not exist, or if no .zpln file matching the prefix is found.
 • ValueError: Raised if multiple .zpln files matching the prefix are found in the target directory. The error message lists the conflicting files and advises using a more specific path including the notebook ID (which can usually be found in the notebook's URL).
 • Other standard exceptions (JSONDecodeError, OSError, Exception) might occur during file reading, JSON parsing, or execution of the imported code.

# How it Works
 1 import_note determines the target directory based on base_dir and notebook_path_prefix.
 2 It scans this directory for .zpln files where the name part before the last underscore (_) matches the final component of the notebook_path_prefix.
 3 It verifies if zero, one, or multiple matches are found.
 4 If exactly one match is found, the .zpln file (which contains JSON) is read.
 5 The JSON content is parsed to extract text from paragraphs identified as Python code (checking for known markers like %python).
 6 The extracted Python code blocks are concatenated into a single string.
 7 This combined code string is executed using exec(code, globals()), making the definitions available in the calling paragraph's global scope
