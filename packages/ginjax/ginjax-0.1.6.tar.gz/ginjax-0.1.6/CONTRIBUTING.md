### Did you find a bug?

**Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Issues](https://github.com/WilsonGregory/ginjax/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/WilsonGregory/ginjax/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and the simplest possible **code sample** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. Also label the issue with the bug label.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable. The PR should also describe how you tested the fix, ideally by adding a test.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing feature?

First, [create an issue](https://github.com/WilsonGregory/ginjax/issues/new) to start a discussion about the feature to determine if it is practicable. If we agree that it is a good feature, feel free to start working on it. Open a PR with your new feature tha describes the changes, how you tested, and if there are any associated documentation changes.

### Do you intend to introduce an example or tutorial?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the example or tutorial. The example should be self-contained and keep import from other packages to minimal. Leave the case-specific analysis detail out.
