## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2025-01-08
### Fixed
- **Enhanced Symbol Resolution**: Fixed critical bug where AI agents failed to use MCP tools correctly
  - Improved `get_symbol_info` method with multiple fallback strategies for resolving class.method paths

  - Better distinction between `get_package_docs` and `get_source_code` usage patterns
  - Added workflow guidance directly in tool descriptions

### Changed
- **Symbol Resolution Logic**: Completely reworked symbol resolution with multiple strategies

  - Strategy 2: Treat entire path as nested symbols in main package  
  - Strategy 3: Progressive module resolution for deep nesting
- **Error Recovery**: Enhanced all MCP tool error responses with structured recovery guidance
  - `recovery_suggestions`: Specific actions to resolve the error
  - `common_fixes`: Common parameter format corrections
