        Multiple Choice pattern, allows blacklisting and whitelisting.
        For example, given a list of dielectric, let the user decide which of them to include or exclude.
        Allowed patterns:
            - all (default): complete list of choices included
            - none: no choices included at all
            - +dielname: include choice named 'dielname'
            - -dielname: exclude choice named 'dielname'
        Examples:
            - all,-nild5,-nild6
               - include all dielectrics except nild5 and nild6
            - none,+nild5,+capild
                - include only dielectrics named nild5 and capild
