## 📖 Overview
This module is based on **[py3xui](https://github.com/iwatkot/py3xui).** 

**Used dependencies:**
- `py3xui` for connecting and managing 3xui panels  
  - `requests` for synchronous API  
  - `httpx` for asynchronous API  
  - `pydantic` for models  
- `diskcache` for storing 3xui cookies  
- `pyotp` for getting OTP passwords based on string  

**Supported Python Versions:**
- `3.11`
- `3.12`

**License:** MIT License

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 💾 Installation
```bash
pip install py_multi_3xui
```

---

## ⚙️ Operating with servers

### ➕ Adding server to database
```python
from py_multi_3xui import Server
from py_multi_3xui import ServerDataManager

username = "Ben"
password = "BenLoveApples123"
host = "https://benserver.com:PORT/PATH/"
internet_speed = 5  # amount in gb per second.
location = "usa"
secret_token_for_2FA = "32secretbase32"

server = Server(admin_username=username,
                password=password,
                host=host,
                location=location,
                internet_speed=internet_speed,
                use_tls_verification=True,
                secret_token_for_2FA=secret_token_for_2FA)

data_manager = ServerDataManager()
data_manager.add_server(server)
```

> 💡 Learn your server's traffic speed by using [Ookla](https://www.speedtest.net/) or ask your VPS seller.  
> ⚠ There is no filtration by valid country code. You can add some silly locations to db

---

### ❌ Deleting server from database
```python
from py_multi_3xui import ServerDataManager

host = "some_server.com:PORT/PATH/"
manager = ServerDataManager()
manager.delete_server(host)
```

---

### 🌍 Get best server by country
```python
from py_multi_3xui import ServerDataManager

manager = ServerDataManager()
location = "usa"
best_server = await manager.choose_best_server_by_location(location)
print(best_server)
```

---

## 👥 Working with clients/configs

### 🆕 Generate client (not add)
```python

from py_multi_3xui import RandomStuffGenerator as rsg
from py_multi_3xui import Server
from py3xui import Client

total_gb = 30
inbound_id = 4
limit_ip = 0
client_email = rsg.generate_email(10)
expiry_time = 30
up = 0
down = 0

#note, generate. NOT ADD. This method returns only client instance
client = Server.generate_client(total_gb=total_gb,
                                inbound_id=inbound_id,
                                limit_ip=limit_ip,
                                client_email=client_email,
                                expiry_time=expiry_time,
                                up=up,
                                down=down)
```

### ➕ Add client to server
```python
from py_multi_3xui import Server
from py3xui import Client

server = ...
client = ...

await server.add_client(client)
```

---

### ✏️ Edit/Update client
```python
from py3xui import Client
from py_multi_3xui import Server

server = ...
client = await server.get_client_by_email("some_email")
client.up = 50
client.down = 30#just edit some client's fields

server.update_client(client)
```

---

### 🔑 Get connection string
```python
from py_multi_3xui import Server
from py3xui import Client
server = ...
client = ...
remark = "MyAwesomeVPN"
port = 443# standard port for VLESS+Reality combo
config = server.get_config(client,remark,port)
```

---

### 🗑 Delete client by uuid
```python
server = ...
uuid = "some uuid"
inbound_id = 4
server.delete_client_by_uuid(client_uuid=uuid, inbound_id=inbound_id)
```
