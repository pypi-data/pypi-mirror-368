Adding summary and show endpoints for neat.data_model (#1261)

# Description

This PR adds (copy) endpoint that summarize and visualize data model in
NeatSession. Also structure of session module has been lightly
restructured for better code organization.

Risk reviewing: This PR does not bring any new functionalities. Methods
already exist but are accessible via functional approach in interaction
with NeatSession. They are copied to be "object oriented" accessible.

This is stacked PR!
