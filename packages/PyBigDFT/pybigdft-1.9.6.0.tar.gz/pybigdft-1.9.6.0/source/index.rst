Welcome to PyBigDFT's documentation!
====================================

This package is a collection of Python Modules that are conceived for pre- and
post- processing of BigDFT input and output files. Such modules are supposed to
enhance the BigDFT experience by high-level approach.
Also, calculators and workflows are supposed to be created and inspected with
modules of the PyBigDFT package.

The documentation of this package is described in
