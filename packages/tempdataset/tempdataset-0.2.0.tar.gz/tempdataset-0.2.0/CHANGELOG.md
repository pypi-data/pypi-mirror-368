## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Future enhancements and features

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-12

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved datetime type mismatch error that was preventing generation of `user_profiles`, `suppliers`, `prescriptions`, and `insurance` datasets
  - Fixed inconsistent return types between Faker and fallback date generation methods
  - Updated `faker_utils.py` to ensure consistent `date` object returns
  - All 40 datasets now generate successfully in both Colab and Kaggle environments
- **API COMPATIBILITY**: Fixed `TempDataFrame.shape` to work both as property and method
  - Users can now use both `df.shape` and `df.shape()` syntax
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
  - Implemented custom descriptor for seamless property/method access

### Changed
- Enhanced error handling and type consistency across datetime operations
- Improved cross-platform compatibility for environments with or without Faker library

### Technical
- Updated type annotations for better type safety
- Enhanced fallback implementations for environments without optional dependencies
- Improved test coverage for datetime edge cases

  - `social_media`: Social media posts with engagement metrics (17 columns)
  - `user_profiles`: Social media user profiles with demographics (17 columns)
- Enhanced CLI with comprehensive dataset listing (now 40 total datasets)
- Complete test coverage for all 40 datasets
- Improved CLI help text with categorized dataset listings

### Fixed
- Fixed CLI syntax errors and improved error handling
