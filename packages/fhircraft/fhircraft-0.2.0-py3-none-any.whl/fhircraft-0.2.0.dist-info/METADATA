  <p align="center">
    Fhircraft is a Python package that dynamically generates Pydantic FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) resource models from FHIR specifications, enabling comprehensive data structuring, validation, and typing within Python. It also offers a fully functional FHIRPath engine and code generation features to facilitate integration with other systems.

## Why use Fhircraft?

- **Dynamic FHIR models** – Generate Pydantic FHIR resource models dynamically from FHIR specification; get all FHIR's data structuring, validation and typing in a pythonic way.

- **Simple FHIR validation** – Perform complete parsing and validation of FHIR resources without leaving Python; avoid dealing with FHIR's often complex rules and constraints. 

- **Pydantic core** – Profit from Pydantic's validation and (de)-serialization capabilities which have made it the most widely used data validation library for Python.     

- **Code generator** – Leverage the code generation features of Fhircraft to write static Pydantic/Python code that can be integrated into other systems. 

- **Pythonic FHIRPath** – Fhircraft provides a fully functional, pythonic and compliant FHIRPath engine to easily work with FHIR resources without leaving Python.  


## Usage 

### Prerequisites

A valid installation of Python >3.8 is required.  


### Installation

To install `fhircraft`, you can download and install the package via `pip` (requires `pip` > 24.1):

```bash
pip install fhircraft
``` 

or install it from the source 

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/luisfabib/fhircraft.git
```

### Getting Started

This is a quick reference on how to quickly accomplish the most common tasks with Fhircraft:

- #### Constructing FHIR Pydantic models 

  To generate a Pydantic model representation for a FHIR resource, use the `construct_resource_model` function. This function automatically creates a model based on the structure definition of the specified resource or profile.
  For optimal control and security, it is recommended to manage FHIR structure definitions as local files. These files should be loaded into Python and parsed into dictionary objects.
  
  ``` python 
    from fhircraft.fhir.resources.factory import construct_resource_model
    from fhircraft.utils import load_file
    patient_model = construct_resource_model(
        structure_definition=load_file('FHIR_StructureDefinition_Patient.json')
    )
  ``` 

- #### Generating Pydantic FHIR models' source code

  Fhircraft allows you to generate reusable source code for Pydantic FHIR models. By using the `generate_resource_model_code` function, you can obtain the source code (as a string) that defines the FHIR Pydantic model. This can be particularly useful for integrating the model into other projects or sharing it across different applications.


  ``` python
  from fhircraft.fhir.resources.generator import generate_resource_model_code
  source_code = generate_resource_model_code(patient_model)
  ```

  You can save the generated source code and reuse it as needed. Keep in mind that the code requires Fhircraft and its dependencies to be installed in order to function properly.

- #### Validating FHIR payloads

  The generated Pydantic models can be used to validate FHIR payloads, ensuring that they conform to the structure and constraints of the specified resource or profile.

  ``` python
  from fhircraft.utils import load_file
  data = load_file('my_fhir_patient.json')
  my_patient = patient_model.model_validate(data)
  ```

  If the input data does not conform to the expected FHIR resource or profile, the Pydantic model will raise a `ValidationError`. If no error is raised, the FHIR payload is valid and successfully loaded into the model.


- #### Model manipulation using FHIRPath

  Fhircraft provides a powerful FHIRPath engine with an enhanced interface for querying and modifying FHIR resources. You can parse FHIRPath expressions and use various methods to retrieve or update values based on your specific needs.

  ``` python
  from fhircraft.fhir.path import fhirpath
  
  # Parse the FHIRPath expression
  name_path = fhirpath.parse('Patient.name.family')
  
  # Get all family names as a list
  all_names = name_path.values(my_patient)
  
  # Get the first family name safely
  first_name = name_path.first(my_patient, default='Unknown')
  
  # Get exactly one family name (raises error if multiple)
  single_name = name_path.single(my_patient)
  
  # Check if family names exist
  has_name = name_path.exists(my_patient)
  
  # Count family names
  name_count = name_path.count(my_patient)
  
  # Update family names
  name_path.update_values(my_patient, 'NewFamilyName')
  ```
