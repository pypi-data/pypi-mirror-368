#. Set a product linked to the elaboration.
#. Also you can select a route to procure this elaboration.
#. Go to *Settings > Inventory > Traceability* and select *Display Elaboration
   notes on Delivery Slips* if you want to show elaborations on Delivery Slips
   or *Display Elaboration notes on Picking Operations* if you want to show

#. In the **Logistics** sections, you can set the desired **Elaboration profile**.

If you want to set an specific elaboration profile for a product:

#. In the **Sales** tab, you'll find an **Elaboration** section where you can set the
   **Elaboration profile** for that specific product.
