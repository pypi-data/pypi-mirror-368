# Khmer Easy Tools

A simple, user-friendly, and self-contained Python library for common Khmer Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This package provides easy-to-use functions for keyword extraction and segmentation without requiring complex external dependencies for its core features.

## Installation

Install the base package:
```bash
pip install khmereasytools
```

### Installing Optional OCR Feature

To use the OCR functionality, you must install the `ocr` extras.
```bash
pip install khmereasytools[ocr]
```

**For OCR functionality**, you must also install Google's Tesseract OCR engine on your system.
-   [Tesseract Installation Guide](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki)
-   Make sure to install the Khmer (`khm`) language data.

## How to Use

### Khmer Character Validation (`is_khmer`)
```python
import khmereasytools as ket
print(ket.is_khmer("សួស្តី"))  # True
```

### Keyword Extraction (`khfilter`)
Uses a built-in segmentation algorithm to find words and remove stop words.
```python
import khmereasytools as ket
text = "នេះគឺជាប្រាសាទអង្គរវត្តស្ថិតនៅក្នុងខេត្តសៀមរាប"
keywords = ket.khfilter(text)
print(f"Keywords: '{{keywords}}'")
```

### Text Segmentation (`khseg`)
Uses a built-in segmentation algorithm to split text into words.
```python
import khmereasytools as ket
text = "នេះគឺជាប្រាសាទអង្គរវត្ត"
words = ket.khseg(text)
print(f"Segmented Words: {words}")
```

### Syllable Segmentation (`khsyllable`)
Uses a built-in rule-based method to split text into syllables.
```python
import khmereasytools as ket
text = "សាលារៀន"
syllables = ket.khsyllable(text)
print(f"Syllables: {syllables}")
```

### OCR from Image (`khocr`)
*Requires `ocr` dependencies to be installed.*
```python
import khmereasytools as ket
# pip install khmereasytools[ocr]
# Make sure you have an image file e.g., 'khmer_text.png'
# text_from_image = ket.khocr('khmer_text.png')
# print(f"Text from OCR: {{text_from_image}}")
```
