## Description

Create the questionnaire class that generates questions using Claude Code SDK and handles user interaction through rich terminal UI

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Questionnaire class generates questions via Claude SDK
- [x] Rich terminal UI displays questions properly
- [x] User input handling with validation works
- [x] Follow-up questions trigger based on responses
- [x] Design data is collected and structured

## Implementation Plan

1. Review existing questionnaire.py structure
2. Implement Claude Code SDK integration for question generation
3. Create rich terminal UI for displaying questions
4. Implement user input handling with validation
5. Add follow-up question logic
6. Structure collected design data into models

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented the interactive questionnaire system with:
- Claude Code SDK integration for dynamic question generation
- Rich terminal UI with panels, tables, and styled prompts
- User input handling with validation for multiple choice and text inputs
- Follow-up question logic based on previous answers
- Data collection and structuring into AppDesign model
- Fallback to default questions if SDK fails
- Comprehensive error handling with KeyboardInterrupt support
- Full linting compliance and proper type hints

Key files modified:
- claude_code_designer/questionnaire.py: Complete implementation

The questionnaire system supports both dynamic question generation via Claude and fallbacks to ensure reliable operation.
