## Description

Test coverage is 70% in questionnaire.py with missing coverage for interactive portions, reducing confidence in code reliability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Test coverage increased to >90% for questionnaire.py
- [x] Interactive user flows are tested
- [x] Integration tests added for user interaction

## Implementation Notes

Added comprehensive test coverage for questionnaire.py. Coverage increased from 67% to 99%, covering all interactive portions, error handling paths, data validation, and edge cases. Added 30+ new test cases covering JSON parsing, user interaction handling, validation logic, and integration flows.
