# Claude Code Designer

Interactive AI-powered design assistant using Claude Code SDK for application and feature design guidance

## Features

- **Interactive Design Assistant**: AI-powered application and feature design guidance using app-designer subagent
- **Conversation Evaluation**: Analyze design conversation quality using conversation-evaluator subagent
- **Automated Simulation**: Run automated design sessions with synthetic scenarios for testing
- **Continuous Learning**: Learn from evaluation results to improve future interactions
- **Clean Terminal Interface**: Straightforward CLI without unnecessary complexity  
- **Conversation History**: Automatically saves design sessions for future reference
- **Programmatic API**: Use design assistant functionality from other Python scripts

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Node.js (for Claude Code CLI)
- Claude Code CLI: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install claude-code-designer
```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-designer
cd claude-code-designer
uv sync --dev
```

## Usage

### Design Assistant

Get AI-powered help designing applications and features:

```bash
# Design a new application interactively
uv run python -m claude_code_designer.cli app

# Design a new feature
uv run python -m claude_code_designer.cli feature

# Non-interactive mode with parameters
uv run python -m claude_code_designer.cli app --name "MyApp" --type web --non-interactive

# List saved conversation history
uv run python -m claude_code_designer.cli list-conversations
```

### Conversation Evaluation

Analyze and evaluate design conversation quality:

```bash
# Evaluate all conversations
uv run python -m claude_code_designer.cli evaluate

# Evaluate a specific conversation
uv run python -m claude_code_designer.cli evaluate --conversation-file conversation_20250106.json

# Custom directories
uv run python -m claude_code_designer.cli evaluate --conversation-dir ./my-conversations --evaluation-dir ./my-evaluations
```

### Simulation and Learning

Run automated design simulations with continuous learning:

```bash
# Run simulation cycles with learning enabled
uv run python -m claude_code_designer.cli simulate --cycles 5 --enable-learning

# Generate app-only or feature-only scenarios
uv run python -m claude_code_designer.cli simulate --type app --cycles 3

# Custom simulation settings
uv run python -m claude_code_designer.cli simulate --delay 3.0 --conversation-dir ./sim-conversations

# Manually trigger learning from evaluations
uv run python -m claude_code_designer.cli learn --evaluation-dir ./simulation_evaluations

# View learning system statistics
uv run python -m claude_code_designer.cli knowledge-stats
```


### Programmatic Usage

Use the design assistant and other components from Python scripts:

```python
from claude_code_designer import DesignAssistant, ConversationEvaluator
import asyncio

async def design_my_app():
    # Design a new application
    assistant = DesignAssistant("./conversations")
    conversation = await assistant.design_application(
        project_name="TaskTracker Pro",
        project_type="web",
        interactive=False,
        max_turns=10
    )
    print(f"Design completed with {conversation['output']['message_count']} messages")
    
    # Evaluate the conversation quality
    evaluator = ConversationEvaluator("./conversations", "./evaluations")
    evaluation = await evaluator.evaluate_conversation(conversation['file_path'])
    print(f"Quality score: {evaluation['scores']['overall']}/10")

asyncio.run(design_my_app())
```

See the `examples/` directory for more usage examples including simulation and learning system integration.
