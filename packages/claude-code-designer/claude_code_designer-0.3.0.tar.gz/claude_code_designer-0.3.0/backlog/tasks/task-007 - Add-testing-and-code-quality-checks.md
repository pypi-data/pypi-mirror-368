## Description

Implement unit tests, integration tests, and ensure code quality with linting and formatting

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for all core functions
- [ ] Integration tests for CLI commands
- [ ] Mock Claude SDK responses for testing
- [ ] Ruff linting passes without errors
- [ ] Code coverage above 80%
- [ ] All functions have proper type hints
## Implementation Plan

1. Create tests directory structure\n2. Add pytest configuration to pyproject.toml\n3. Create unit tests for models.py (Pydantic validation)\n4. Create unit tests for questionnaire.py (mock Claude SDK)\n5. Create unit tests for generator.py (mock Claude SDK)\n6. Create integration tests for CLI commands\n7. Run ruff linting and fix issues\n8. Check code coverage and ensure >80%\n9. Verify type hints on all functions

## Implementation Notes

Implemented comprehensive test suite with 64 tests covering all core functionality:

**Unit Tests Created:**
- models.py: 14 tests covering Pydantic validation for Question, AppDesign, and DocumentRequest models
- questionnaire.py: 19 tests covering interactive questionnaire system with mocked Claude SDK responses
- generator.py: 17 tests covering document generation engine with error handling
- cli.py: 14 integration tests covering CLI commands and error scenarios

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- Fixed import statement in questionnaire.py (moved json import to top)
- Fixed string formatting bug in generator.py README fallback
- Added missing type hints to CLI functions
- All linting issues resolved with ruff
- Code formatted consistently

**Test Coverage Results:**
- Total coverage: 85% (exceeds 80% requirement)
- All 64 tests passing
- Comprehensive mocking of Claude SDK async responses
- Error handling scenarios covered
- Integration tests for CLI workflows

**Technical Achievements:**
- Set up pytest with async support and coverage reporting
- Implemented proper async mocking patterns for SDK
- Added comprehensive error scenario testing
- Created fixtures for reusable test data
- Followed project KISS principles in test design
