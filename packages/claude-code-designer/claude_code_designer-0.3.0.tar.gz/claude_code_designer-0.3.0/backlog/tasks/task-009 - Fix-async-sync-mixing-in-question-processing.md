## Description

The _process_question method is declared as async but is being called in a mixed sync/async pattern that could cause issues in questionnaire.py:32

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Method uses consistent async pattern
- [x] No sync/async mixing warnings
- [x] Question processing works correctly

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze the async/sync mixing issue in questionnaire.py:32
2. Review _process_question method to understand the mixing pattern
3. Fix the async pattern to be consistent throughout
4. Test that question processing still works correctly
5. Run linting to ensure no warnings remain

## Implementation Notes

Fixed the async/sync mixing issue in questionnaire.py by changing the `_process_question` method from async to synchronous:

**Problem:** The `_process_question` method was declared as `async def` but only called synchronous methods (`_handle_multiple_choice` and `_handle_text_input`), creating unnecessary async/sync mixing.

**Solution:** 
- Changed method signature from `async def _process_question` to `def _process_question` on line 146
- Removed `await` calls to this method on lines 32 and 41
- Method now follows consistent synchronous pattern since it only performs synchronous operations

**Testing:**
- All 64 tests pass
- Linting passes with no warnings  
- Question processing functionality remains intact
- No performance impact - method executes synchronously as it should
