## Description

Create the document generator that uses Claude Code SDK to generate PRD.md, CLAUDE.md, and README.md files based on design specifications

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] - [x] DocumentGenerator class with template methods
- [x] PRD generation with proper structure
- [x] CLAUDE.md generation with technical details
- [x] README generation with user guidance
- [x] Documents saved to specified directory
- [x] Async Claude SDK integration works properly
## Implementation Plan

1. Implement DocumentGenerator class with async methods for each document type
2. Create template methods for PRD, CLAUDE.md, and README generation  
3. Integrate Claude Code SDK using async patterns
4. Add file saving functionality with proper directory handling
5. Implement error handling for SDK calls and file operations
6. Test document generation with sample AppDesign data

## Implementation Notes

Implemented DocumentGenerator class with async methods for generating PRD, CLAUDE.md, and README files using Claude Code SDK. Key features:

- Created DocumentGenerator class with separate methods for each document type
- Integrated Claude Code SDK using async patterns with proper error handling
- Added file saving functionality with UTF-8 encoding and directory creation
- Implemented comprehensive prompts for each document type following project requirements
- Added basic error handling that gracefully falls back to error messages in documents
- Successfully tested document generation with sample data

Modified files:
- claude_code_designer/generator.py: Complete implementation of document generation engine

The implementation follows KISS principles with simple, straightforward async patterns and basic error handling as requested in the project guidelines.
