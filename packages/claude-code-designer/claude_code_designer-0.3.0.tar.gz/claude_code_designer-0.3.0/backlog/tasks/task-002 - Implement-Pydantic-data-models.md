## Description

Create the core data models using Pydantic for questions, application design, and document requests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Question model with validation exists
- [ ] AppDesign model captures all design data
- [ ] DocumentRequest model for generation config
- [ ] All models have proper type hints and validation

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze PRD and requirements for data models
2. Create Question model for questionnaire system
3. Create AppDesign model to capture all design information
4. Create DocumentRequest model for generation configuration
5. Add proper validation and type hints
6. Test models with sample data

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented all required Pydantic data models:

1. Question model: Handles questionnaire questions with validation for id, text, type, options, and follow-up logic
2. AppDesign model: Captures comprehensive application design data including name, type, features, tech stack, and constraints
3. DocumentRequest model: Manages document generation configuration with flags for each document type

Key features implemented:
- Proper type hints using modern Python syntax (list[str] instead of List[str])
- Field validation with descriptive help text
- Default values using default_factory for lists and dicts
- Optional fields with proper None typing
- Comprehensive docstrings for all models

All models tested and validated successfully. Code passes linting with ruff.
