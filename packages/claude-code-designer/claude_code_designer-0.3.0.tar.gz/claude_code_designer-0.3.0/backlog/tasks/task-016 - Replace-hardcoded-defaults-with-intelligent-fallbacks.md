## Description

Hardcoded fallback values like 'My Application' and 'Web Application' in questionnaire.py:249-250 provide poor user experience

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Intelligent defaults are implemented
- [x] User gets meaningful fallback values
- [x] Default values are contextually appropriate

## Implementation Plan

1. Examine current hardcoded defaults in questionnaire.py\n2. Implement context-aware fallback generation\n3. Add intelligent naming based on app type and purpose\n4. Update tests to verify new behavior\n5. Run linting and tests

## Implementation Notes

Implemented intelligent fallback logic for application names based on app type and purpose. Changed hardcoded 'My Application' default to context-aware names: CLI tools get 'utility-cli', API services get 'auth-service' etc. Updated all tests to verify new behavior. Improved user experience with meaningful defaults.
