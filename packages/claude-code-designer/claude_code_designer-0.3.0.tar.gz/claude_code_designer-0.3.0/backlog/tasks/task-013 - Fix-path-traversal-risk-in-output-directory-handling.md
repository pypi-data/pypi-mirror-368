## Description

User-provided output_dir is used directly without validation in generator.py:23-24, allowing potential path traversal attacks

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Output directory path is validated and sanitized
- [x] Path traversal attempts are blocked
- [x] Files can only be written to intended directory

## Implementation Plan

1. Add input validation method to DocumentGenerator class
2. Implement comprehensive path traversal protection
3. Check for obvious invalid paths (empty, whitespace)
4. Validate against path traversal patterns in original input
5. Resolve paths and ensure they're within safe boundaries
6. Add comprehensive tests for various attack vectors
7. Update document generation to use validated paths

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive path traversal protection:
- Added `_validate_output_path()` method with multi-layered validation
- Validates empty/whitespace paths upfront
- Checks for path traversal patterns before and after path resolution
- Ensures resolved paths stay within current directory or are valid absolute paths
- Blocks common traversal attacks: `../`, `../../`, mixed patterns
- Added comprehensive test coverage for valid paths, malicious patterns, and edge cases
- All existing functionality preserved while security vulnerabilities eliminated
- Files modified: claude_code_designer/generator.py, tests/test_generator.py
