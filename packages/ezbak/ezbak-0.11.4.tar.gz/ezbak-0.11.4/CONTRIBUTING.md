## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management. To start developing:

1. Install uv using the [recommended method](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/installation/) for your operating system
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/natelandau/ezbak`
3. Navigate to the repository: `cd ezbak`
4. Install dependencies with uv: `uv sync`
5. Activate your virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
6. Install pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install --install-hooks`

### Running Tasks

We use [Duty](https://pawamoy.github.io/duty/) as our task runner. Common tasks:

-   `duty --list` - List all available tasks
-   `duty lint` - Run all linters
-   `duty test` - Run all tests
-   `duty dev-clean` - Clean the development environment
-   `duty dev-setup` - Set up the development environment

## Local Development Environment

To set up a local development environment, run `duty dev-setup`. This will create a development environment in the `.dev` directory.

```
.dev
├── backups
├── logs
├── restore
└── source
    ├── project1
    │   ├── bar.txt
    │   ├── baz.txt
    │   ├── foo.txt
    │   └── some_dir
    │       ├── bar.txt
    │       ├── baz.txt
    │       └── foo.txt
    └── project2
        ├── bar.txt
        ├── baz.txt
        ├── foo.txt
        └── some_dir
            ├── bar.txt
            ├── baz.txt
            └── foo.txt
```

Use the directory structure to test the development environment.

### Testing the Docker Entrypoint

Docker is configured entirely with environment variables. To test the entrypoint follow these steps:

1. Run `duty dev-setup` to create the development environment. This will create a `.dev/` folder and create a `.env` file at the project root.
2. Edit the `.env` file at the project root to configure the environment
3. Run `uv run -m ezbak.entrypoint` to run the entrypoint; or
4. Run `docker compose up` to run the docker container
