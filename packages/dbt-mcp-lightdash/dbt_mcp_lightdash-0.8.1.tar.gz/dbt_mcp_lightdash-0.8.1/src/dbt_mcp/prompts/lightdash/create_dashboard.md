Create a new dashboard in Lightdash.

Dashboards can contain multiple charts and markdown tiles arranged in a grid layout.
Supports automatic layout presets (auto, single_column, two_column) or custom tile positioning.
Charts must already exist before adding them to a dashboard.

Examples:
- "Create a new executive dashboard with the revenue and customer charts"
- "Build a dashboard called 'Sales Overview' with a 2-column layout"
- "Create an empty dashboard named 'Marketing Metrics' in the Marketing space"
