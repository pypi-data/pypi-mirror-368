A small project for quickly updating `.xlsx` workbooks from Rust or Python.
It consists of two crates:

* **rust-core** – the core library that works directly with spreadsheet XML.
* **python-bindings** – Python wrapper built with `pyo3` and `maturin`.

The library lets you append rows or tables, modify individual cells and
save the workbook back to disk without loading the entire file into memory.

For detailed usage examples see [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).
