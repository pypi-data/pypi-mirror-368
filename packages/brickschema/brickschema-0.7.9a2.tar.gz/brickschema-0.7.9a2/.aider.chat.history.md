To switch from Poetry to UV, you need to refactor your `pyproject.toml` to use the standard PEP 621 `[project]` table and `[build-system]` configuration. This involves:

1.  Migrating project metadata, dependencies, and script entry points from Poetry's specific `[tool.poetry]` format to `[project]` and `[project.optional-dependencies]`.
2.  Adjusting version specifiers to common PEP 440 formats (e.g., `~=` or `>=`).
3.  Updating the `[build-system]` to use `setuptools`, which is a common build backend compatible with UV.
4.  Removing Poetry-specific configurations like `include` and the path-based `pyontoenv` dependency, as these are handled differently with standard build tools and UV.

Brick requires Python >= 3.6. We use [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run code formatters and style checkers when you commit.

Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage packaging and dependencies. After installing poetry, install dependencies with:

```bash
poetry install
```

Enter the development environment with the following command (this is analogous to activating a virtual environment.

```bash
poetry shell

#### update the github action to use uv instead of poetry  

To update the GitHub Action workflow to use uv instead of Poetry, I will modify `.github/workflows/builds.yml`.

The changes involve:
1.  Replacing the Poetry installation step with `astral-sh/setup-uv` for installing uv and setting up Python versions.
2.  Removing the separate `actions/setup-python` step as `setup-uv` handles Python installation.
3.  Updating the dependency installation commands from `poetry install` to `uv sync`.
4.  Updating the test command to use `uv run pytest`.

#### when using 'expand', default to the 'topquadrant' engine if it is available, else fallback to 'pyshacl'  

To implement the requested change, I will modify the `expand` method in `brickschema/graph.py`. The `shacl` profile will now default to using the 'topquadrant' engine if the `brick_tq_shacl` package is available. If it's not available, or if 'pyshacl' is explicitly specified, it will fall back to using 'pyshacl'.

#### clean up and fix the logic for validate and expand so that they use the fastest engine available. For "owlrl" the fastest engines are: reasonable, allegrograph, owlrl. For "shacl" the fastest engines are: topquadrant, pyshacl.  

I will clean up the logic in the `validate` and `expand` methods in `brickschema/graph.py` to automatically use the fastest available engine when one is not specified.

For the `validate` method and for SHACL-based operations in the `expand` method, I will implement a check for the `topquadrant` engine (`brick_tq_shacl`) and use it if available, falling back to `pyshacl` otherwise.

For OWLRL-based operations in the `expand` method, I will set `reasonable` as the default backend, which is the fastest. I will also fix the logic to ensure that the selected backend is actually used for inference, and that inference is performed only for the appropriate profiles (`owlrl`, `vbis`).

Here are the required changes:
