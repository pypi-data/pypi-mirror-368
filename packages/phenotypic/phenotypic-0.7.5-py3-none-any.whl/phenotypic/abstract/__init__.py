"""
A module dedicated to performing various image-related and measurement operations.

This module provides an extensive suite of tools for image manipulation, object detection,
grid operations, and measurements. It includes features for image enhancement, image correction,
threshold-based detection, and working with structured grids. This module also facilitates
measurement operations related to features or grid data. It serves as a foundational module
in applications requiring advanced image and measurement operations.
