class GridAlignmentOutlierRemover(GridMapModifier):
    """
    Identifies and removes linear regression residual outliers in a grid-based image.

    This class is designed to analyze the variance of each row and column in a grid-based image.
    Rows or columns with variances exceeding a specified maximum threshold are analyzed further for
    residual outliers using linear regression. Objects with residuals above the defined cutoff
    (mean + standard deviation * multiplier) are considered outliers and removed. This is useful for
    removing noise that interferes with gridding

    Attributes:
        axis (Optional[int]): Axis to analyze for outliers. If None, both rows and columns are
            analyzed; 0 analyzes rows; 1 analyzes columns.
        cutoff_multiplier (float): Multiplier to define the cutoff for residual error relative
            to the standard deviation. Higher values make the cutoff less strict.
        max_coeff_variance (int): Maximum coefficient of variance (standard deviation divided
            by mean) allowed for rows or columns before they are analyzed for outliers.

        """
        Processes a GridImage to identify and remove row-wise and column-wise outlier
        objects based on residual errors and coefficient of variance.

        Outlier identification is performed by first calculating the coefficient of
        variance for each row or column. Rows or columns with variance above a specified
        threshold are considered for outlier detection. Within these rows or columns,
        objects with residual errors exceeding a computed cutoff based on standard
        deviation multiplier are identified and subsequently removed.

        Args:
            image (GridImage): The GridImage object that represents the input_image grid
                containing object information for analysis and modification.

        Returns:
            GridImage: The modified GridImage object with outlier objects removed.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If max_coeff_variance or cutoff_multiplier attributes are not
                properly specified for the operation.
