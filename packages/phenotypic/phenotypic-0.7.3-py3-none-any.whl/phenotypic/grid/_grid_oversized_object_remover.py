class GridOversizedObjectRemover(GridMapModifier):
    """
    Removes oversized objects from grid-based image data.

    This class inherits from `GridMapModifier` and is designed to remove objects from the
    grid-based image representation that exceed the maximum allowable width or height of the
    grid cells. The removal process sets the oversized object regions to the background other_image
    of 0. This class is useful for preprocessing grid images for further analysis or visualization.

    def _operate(self, image: GridImage) -> GridImage:
        """
        Applies operations on the given GridImage to remove objects based on maximum width and height constraints.

        This method processes the grid metadata of a `GridImage` object to identify objects
        that exceed the maximum calculated width and height. It sets such objects to a
        background other_image of 0 in the object's mapping array. This helps filter out undesired
        large objects in the image.

            image (GridImage): The input_image grid image containing grid metadata and object map.

        Returns:
            GridImage: The processed grid image with specified objects removed.
