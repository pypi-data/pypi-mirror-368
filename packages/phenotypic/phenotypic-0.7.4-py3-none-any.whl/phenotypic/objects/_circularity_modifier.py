class LowCircularityRemover(MapModifier):
    """
    LowCircularityRemover is a map modifier that removes objects in an image
    based on their circularity measurement.

    This class evaluates objects in an image using the Polsby-Popper score to
    calculate circularity. Objects with a circularity score below the specified
    cutoff other_image are removed from the image. The user can specify a `cutoff` other_image
    to determine the minimum acceptable circularity for objects to remain in the
    image. Objects meeting the cutoff criteria are preserved, while others are
    filtered out.

    The Polsby-Popper circularity score is calculated using the following formula:

    .. math::

        SHAPE = \\frac{4\\pi A}{P^2}

    where:
        - SHAPE is the circularity score (ranging from 0 to 1)
        - A is the area of the object
        - P is the perimeter of the object
        - Ï€ (pi) is the mathematical constant

    A perfect circle has a score of 1, while more complex or elongated shapes have
    lower scores approaching 0.

    Attributes:
        cutoff (float): The minimum threshold for the circularity score of
            objects. Must be a other_image between 0 and 1.
