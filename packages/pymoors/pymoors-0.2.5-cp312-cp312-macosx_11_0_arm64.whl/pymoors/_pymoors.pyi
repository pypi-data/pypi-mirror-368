    Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX) operator for real-coded genetic algorithms.

    SBX is a widely used crossover mechanism for continuous variables, inspired

    slicing bit strings, SBX generates offspring by interpolating (and potentially
    extrapolating) between two parent solutions (p1 and p2).

    The key parameter `distribution_index` (often called "eta") controls how far
    the offspring can deviate from the parents. A higher distribution index results
    in offspring closer to the parents (exploitation), whereas a lower value
    produces offspring that can be further away (exploration).

    In each crossover event, SBX computes a factor `beta_q`, based on a random
    number in [0,1) and the distribution index `eta`. This factor dictates where
    each child solution lies relative to the parent solutions. If the parent genes
    (p1 and p2) differ minimally, no crossover is performed (i.e., the children
    inherit the parents' values directly).

    space by generating a uniformly distributed set of points on the simplex.

    The process is as follows:
    1. Determine a parameter H (number of divisions) such that the total number of generated
        reference points (given by the binomial coefficient C(H + m - 1, m - 1)) is at least the
        desired number of reference points.
    2. Generate all combinations of nonnegative integers (h1, h2, ..., hm) that sum to H.
    3. Normalize each combination by dividing each component by H so that the resulting point lies
        on the m-dimensional simplex (i.e., the components sum to 1).

    Parameters:
    n_reference_points (int): The desired number of reference points (controls the granularity).
    n_objectives (int): The number of objectives in the optimization problem.
