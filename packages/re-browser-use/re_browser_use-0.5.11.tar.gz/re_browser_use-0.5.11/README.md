<h1 align="center">Enable AI to control your browser 🤖</h1>

___A patched, drop-in replacement for [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use), capable of defeating Cloudflare's verification.___

This little project was created because I was fed up with getting blocked by Cloudflare's verification and I wanted to do things like this with Browser Use:

```bash
python examples\nopecha_cloudflare.py
```

I have added OS level clicks in headful mode to be able to use ProtonVPN. Credit again to [Vinyzu](https://github.com/Vinyzu),
as I used a pruned and slightly modified version of his [CDP-Patches](https://github.com/imamousenotacat/re-cdp-patches) project for this. 

The one below, I think, is a browser-use test that has been long-awaited and sought after for quite a while 😜:

```bash
python tests/ci/evaluate_tasks.py --task tests/agent_tasks/captcha_cloudflare.yaml
```

If it looks slow, it is because I'm using a small and free LLM and an old computer worth $100. 

# Quick start

This is how you can see for yourself how it works:

Install the package using pip (Python>=3.11):

```bash
pip install re-browser-use
```

Install the browser. I'm using Chromium; it works OK for me. The project uses a [tweaked version of patchright](https://github.com/imamousenotacat/re-patchright)

```bash
re-patchright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

Create a minimalistic `.env` file. This is what I use. I'm a poor mouse and I can afford only free things. 🙂

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=false
SKIP_LLM_API_KEY_VERIFICATION=true
HEADLESS_EVALUATION=false
```

And finally tell your agent to pass Cloudflare's verification:

```bash
python examples\nopecha_cloudflare.py
```

This is the code of the example file 

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI

async def main():
  agent = await Agent.create_stealth_agent(
    task=(
      "Go to https://nopecha.com/demo/cloudflare, wait for the verification checkbox to appear, click it once, and wait for 10 seconds."
      "That’s all. If you get redirected, don’t worry."
    ),
    llm=ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17"),
  )
  await agent.run(10)

asyncio.run(main())
```

I have in the same directory an 'unfolded' version of the code named _nopecha_cloudflare_unfolded.py_.   
By _"unfolded"_ I mean that my simple helper static method _'Agent.create_stealth_agent'_ is not used. So we can test it with _"regular"_ patchright and browser-use:

Uninstall re-patchright (including the browsers, to be thorough) and re-browser-use and install patchright and browser-use instead: 

```bash
re-patchright uninstall --all 
pip uninstall re-patchright -y
pip uninstall re-browser-use -y

pip install patchright
patchright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
pip install browser-use==0.5.11 # This is the last version I've patched so far
```

Now execute the program 

```bash
python examples\nopecha_cloudflare_unfolded.py
```

![nopecha_cloudflare_unfolded.py KO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imamousenotacat/re-browser-use/main/images/nopecha_cloudflare_unfolded.py.KO.gif)

With the current versions of patchright and browser-use, this won't work.

They can't detect the checkbox (well, to be precise, patchright can see it, but it needs a little extra push).

## Why is this project not a PR?

I don't want to ruffle any feathers, but we, humble but rebellious mice 😜, don't like signing CLAs or working for free for someone who, 
[by their own admission](https://browser-use.com/careers), is here to "dominate". I do this just for fun. 

Besides, the code provided by this patch won't work if it's not accompanied by [re-patchright-python](https://github.com/imamousenotacat/re-patchright-python).

I just wanted to make this work public. If someone finds this useful, they can incorporate it into their own projects.
