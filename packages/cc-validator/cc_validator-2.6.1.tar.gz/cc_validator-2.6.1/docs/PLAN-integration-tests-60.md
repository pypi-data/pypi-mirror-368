# Integration Test Plan for Claude Code Hook Execution (#60)

## MVP

### Milestone 1: Mock Claude Code Environment
[ ] Create mock hook invocation framework that simulates Claude Code's behavior
[ ] Implement timeout handling (8000ms limit) with proper cancellation
[ ] Add support for all tool types (Write, Edit, Bash, MultiEdit, Update, TodoWrite)
[ ] Create test fixtures for transcript and tool input formats
[ ] Write unit tests for mock environment

### Milestone 2: Core Integration Tests
[ ] Test successful validation flow for each tool type
[ ] Test rejection flow with proper exit codes (2 for block, 0 for allow)
[ ] Test timeout scenarios (validation exceeding 8000ms)
[ ] Test API key missing scenarios (should allow with warning)
[ ] Write unit tests for integration test helpers

### Milestone 3: Error Handling Tests
[ ] Test network failures during API calls
[ ] Test malformed input handling
[ ] Test processor initialization failures
[ ] Test concurrent validation requests
[ ] Write unit tests for error scenarios

### Milestone 4: Hook Configuration Tests
[ ] Test hook matcher patterns work correctly
[ ] Test hook installation and configuration
[ ] Test CI mode vs local mode behavior
[ ] Test file storage in non-CI mode
[ ] Write unit tests for configuration

## Future Enhancement

### Enhanced Mock Environment
[ ] Add support for simulating Claude Code's actual tool execution
[ ] Mock file system operations for testing side effects
[ ] Add performance benchmarking for validation times
[ ] Create visual test reporter

### Advanced Test Scenarios
[ ] Test validation with very large files
[ ] Test validation with binary files
[ ] Test validation with unicode/special characters
[ ] Test validation under memory pressure
[ ] Test validation with rate limiting

### CI/CD Integration
[ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow for integration tests
[ ] Create test matrix for different Python versions
[ ] Add code coverage reporting
[ ] Create performance regression tests
[ ] Add nightly test runs with full test suite

### Developer Experience
[ ] Create test data generators for common scenarios
[ ] Add debugging helpers for failed tests
[ ] Create interactive test runner
[ ] Add test result visualization
[ ] Create test documentation with examples
