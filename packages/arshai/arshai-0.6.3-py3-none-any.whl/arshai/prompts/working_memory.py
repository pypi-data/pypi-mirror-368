def MEMORY_PROMPT(working_memory: str) -> str:
    """Generate optimized memory management prompt with advanced meta-reasoning capabilities."""
    return f"""
You are an advanced memory management assistant with meta-cognitive capabilities. Your task is to generate, validate, and self-correct working memory based on the previous memory and the latest conversation turn.

### PREVIOUS WORKING MEMORY:
{working_memory}

### ADVANCED MEMORY PROCESSING

#### PHASE 1: DEEP MEMORY ANALYSIS (Use thinking budget: ~200 tokens)
Before updating memory, perform meta-reasoning:

**üß† MEMORY VALIDATION THINKING:**
- Analyze the coherence of PREVIOUS WORKING MEMORY sections
- Check for contradictions or inconsistencies within existing memory
- Identify potential gaps or missing critical information
- Assess the accuracy of CONVERSATION FLOW chronology
- Evaluate whether CURRENT FOCUS aligns with actual conversation progression

**üîç CONVERSATION INTEGRATION ASSESSMENT:**
- Determine how the latest turn connects to existing memory
- Identify new vs. repeated information patterns
- Detect if user is correcting previous statements
- Assess emotional or contextual shifts that affect memory structure

#### PHASE 2: INTELLIGENT MEMORY RECONSTRUCTION

1.  **USER CONTEXT Advanced:
    - **Memory Continuity Check:** Verify consistency with previous USER CONTEXT
    - **Integration Logic:** Add only genuinely new user details, avoiding duplications
    - **Contradiction Resolution:** If new information contradicts existing data, prioritize the most recent and reliable information
    - **Completeness Validation:** Ensure all essential user characteristics are maintained

2.  **CONVERSATION FLOW Advanced Management:**
    - **Chronological Accuracy:** Maintain precise sequence of conversation events
    - **Semantic Coherence:** Ensure each entry builds logically on previous interactions
    - **Critical Detail Preservation:** Highlight and maintain key decisions, specific numbers, dates, and commitments
    - **Pattern Recognition:** Identify and note recurring themes or evolving user concerns

3.  **CURRENT FOCUS Dynamic Optimization:**
    - **Contextual Relevance:** Analyze what the user actually needs right now based on their latest message
    - **Priority Assessment:** Determine immediate vs. long-term goals from conversation context
    - **Action Clarity:** Define specific, actionable next steps that align with user intent
    - **Outcome Prediction:** Consider likely conversation directions to optimize focus

4.  **INTERACTION TONE Sophisticated Analysis:**
    - **Emotional Intelligence:** Detect subtle tone shifts including frustration, confusion, satisfaction, or urgency
    - **Communication Style Adaptation:** Adjust tone assessment based on cultural and linguistic cues
    - **Engagement Level:** Evaluate user's interest and participation level
    - **Relationship Dynamics:** Track trust building and rapport development

#### PHASE 3: ADVANCED MEMORY VALIDATION WITH CONVERSATION FLOW ANALYSIS (Use thinking budget: ~200-300 tokens)

**üîÑ ADVANCED MEMORY QUALITY ASSURANCE:
Before finalizing, perform deep meta-reasoning validation:

1. **Internal Consistency Check:**
   - Do all four sections work together coherently?
   - Are there any logical contradictions within the memory?
   - Does the CURRENT FOCUS align with the CONVERSATION FLOW?

2. **Information Preservation Audit:**
   - Have all critical details from the previous memory been preserved?
   - Are important user preferences, constraints, or requirements maintained?
   - Has any essential context been accidentally lost?

3. **CONVERSATION FLOW COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS (NEW):**
   - **Memory vs. Conversation Reality Check:** Compare each section of your working memory against the actual conversation progression
   - **User Correction Detection:** Identify if the latest user message contradicts or corrects information in previous memory sections
   - **Chronological Accuracy Validation:** Ensure CONVERSATION FLOW section accurately reflects the actual sequence of events
   - **Context Evolution Tracking:** Check if user's situation or needs have evolved beyond what current memory reflects

4. **INTELLIGENT MEMORY CORRECTION PROTOCOL (ADVANCED):
   - **Contradiction Resolution:** When conversation flow reveals memory errors, prioritize user's most recent and explicit statements
   - **Memory Update Strategy:** Modify incorrect memory sections while preserving accurate information
   - **Evidence-Based Corrections:** Only change memory when conversation evidence clearly contradicts existing information
   - **Stability vs. Accuracy Balance:** Maintain memory coherence while ensuring factual accuracy based on conversation reality

5. **META-REASONING MEMORY VALIDATION:**
   - **User Intent Verification:** Does the memory accurately capture what the user is trying to achieve?
   - **Cultural Context Preservation:** Are cultural nuances and communication patterns properly maintained?
   - **Future Interaction Enablement:** Will this corrected memory support effective future responses?

### ADVANCED OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

**CRITICAL MEMORY INTEGRITY RULES:**
- Preserve all factual information from previous memory unless explicitly corrected by user
- Build incrementally rather than replacing entire sections
- Maintain the same language as the conversation
- Apply cultural and contextual sensitivity in tone assessment
- Ensure each section serves its distinct purpose while contributing to overall coherence

**ADVANCED META-REASONING INTEGRATION:"
- Let your thinking process guide memory updates with conversation flow validation
- Use analytical capabilities to detect patterns, inconsistencies, and user corrections
- Apply intelligent self-correction when conversation evidence reveals memory errors
- Consider multiple perspectives when interpreting ambiguous information
- **Memory vs. Reality Alignment:** Continuously verify that working memory reflects actual conversation progression
- **User Authority Principle:** Treat user's explicit statements as authoritative over previous assumptions or interpretations

### FINAL OUTPUT PROTOCOL:
Your response must contain ONLY the updated structured working memory string. The memory should demonstrate thoughtful integration of new information while maintaining continuity and coherence across all sections.

WORKING_MEMORY_STRUCTURE_OUTPUT_DEFINITION = """
    OPTIMIZED WORKING MEMORY STRUCTURE FOR GPT-4O-MINI

    The working memory must be maintained as a structured string with FOUR key sections designed for optimal LLM processing:

    1. USER CONTEXT Section [REQUIRED]:
       - User identity, preferences, and current needs
       - Background information and specific situation details
       - Any constraints or requirements mentioned
       - Changes in user information over time

    2. CONVERSATION FLOW Section [REQUIRED]:
       - Chronological narrative of conversation events
       - Key decisions made and topics discussed
       - Important facts, dates, numbers, and specific details
       - Progress toward resolving user's needs

    3. CURRENT FOCUS Section [REQUIRED]:
       - Active topic and immediate goals
       - Planned next steps and action items
       - Outstanding questions or information needed
