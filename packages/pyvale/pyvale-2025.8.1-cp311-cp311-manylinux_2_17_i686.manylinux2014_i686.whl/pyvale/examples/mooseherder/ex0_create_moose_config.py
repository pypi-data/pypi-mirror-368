Creating a configuration file
================================================================================

In this example we generate a json config file which help mooseherder find the
paths to moose apps we want to use in the future.


**Installing moose**: To run future examples you will need to have moose
on your system. As moose supports unix operating systems windows users will need
to use windows subsystem for linux (WSL). We use the proteus moose build which
can be found here: https://github.com/aurora-multiphysics/proteus. Build scripts
for common linux distributions can be found in the 'scripts' directory of the
repo. You can also create your own moose build using instructions here:
https://mooseframework.inl.gov/.

We start by importing what we need for this example.
"""

#%%#
# We start with imports for paths and for our moose configuration object.
from pathlib import Path

# Pyvale imports
from pyvale.mooseherder import MooseConfig

#%%
# A moose configuration is a dictionary with these three keys "main_path",
# "app_path" and "app_name". The first two keys retur resolved paths for moose
# and the app you are using. The last key returns the string used call your
# moose app on the command line. Once we have this dictionary we can build our
# moose config object which will perform some checks for us to see if the
# configuration is valid.
config = {'main_path': Path.home()/ 'moose',
          'app_path': Path.home() / 'proteus',
          'app_name': 'proteus-opt'}

moose_config = MooseConfig(config)

#%%
# We are going to save our moose configuration to the default output path for
# pyvale so if this default output path does not exist we create it. Then all we
# need to do is call the save configuration method and give it a path and file
# name for the json we want to save.
output_path = Path.cwd() / "pyvale-output"
if not output_path.is_dir():
    output_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

config_path = Path.cwd() / 'moose-config.json'
moose_config.save_config(config_path)

#%%
# Now we have our moose configuration we can use it to run moose with
# mooseherder's mooserunner and mooseherd classes which we will see in later
# examples. For now we will move on to demonstrate how mooseherder modifies
# input files for gmsh and moose.
