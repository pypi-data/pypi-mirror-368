"""Basics: Multi-physics experiment simulation in 2D
================================================================================

In previous examples we have built our virtual sensor array and used this to
run a single simulated experiment. However, we will generally want to run many
simulated experiments and perform statistical analysis on the results. In this
example we demonstrate how `pyvale` can be used to run a set of simulated
experiments with a series of sensor arrays, one measuring temperature and the
other measuring strain. We also show how this analysis can be performed over a
set of input physics simulations.

Note that this tutorial assumes you are familiar with the use of `pyvale` for
scalar and tensor fields as described in the previous examples.

Test case: thermo-mechanical analysis of a 2D plate with a temperature gradient.
