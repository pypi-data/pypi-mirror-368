Basics: Custom vector field sensors
================================================================================

In this example we build a custom vector field sensor array which mimics the
sensor array we built with the factory in the previous example.

Note that this tutorial assumes you are familiar with the use of pyvale for
scalar fields as described in the first set of examples.

Test case: point displacement sensors on a 2D plate with hole loaded in tension

# This is the key different between building a vector field sensor vs a
# scalar field sensor. Here we create a vector field object which we will
# pass to our sensor array. In later examples we will see that the process
# is the same for tensor fields (e.g. strain) where we create a tensor field
# object and pass this to our sensor array. One thing to note is that the
# number of field components will be different here for a 2D vs 3D
# simulation. Also, it is worth noting that the element dimensions
# parameter does not need to match the number of field components. For
# example: it is possible to have a surface mesh (elem_dims=2) where we
# have all 3 components of the displacement field.

# which determines how many point sensors we have and their sampling times.
# For vector field sensors we can also define the sensor orientation here
# which we will demonstrate in the next example.
