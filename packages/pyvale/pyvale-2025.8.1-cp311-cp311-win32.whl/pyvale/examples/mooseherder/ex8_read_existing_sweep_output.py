"""
Reading results from a pre-run parameter sweep
================================================================================

In this example we will read in the output of a parameter sweep performed by the
'herd' workflow manager specifically showing how we can read a sweep if we don't
have the original directory manager.

**NOTE**: this example assumes you have run one of the previous examples using
the herd workflow manager and that there is a series of output simulation
working directories in the pyvale-output directory. If not please run the
example called 'Running a parameter sweep of a MOOSE simulation' first.

We start by importing what we need for this example.

# First we create a directory manager and pass it our standard pyvale output
# directory where our simulation sweep output is. The number of directories here
# is not critical as long as it is equal to or larger than the number of working
# directories you used when you ran your sweep it will find all simulation
# outputs that exist in the working directories.
output_base_path = Path.cwd() / "pyvale-output"
dir_manager = DirectoryManager(n_dirs=4)
dir_manager.set_base_dir(output_base_path)

#%%
# We now pass the directory manager into a sweep reader setting the option to
# read our sweep output in parallel. Note that for small output files reading
# the output in parallel will probably be slower than reading sequentially so
# make sure you test the reader for your particular case.
#
# We then use the reader extract the list of list of output file paths and the
# combinations of variables that were used for this parameter sweep.
sweep_reader = SweepReader(dir_manager,num_para_read=4)

output_files = sweep_reader.read_all_output_file_keys()
sweep_variables = sweep_reader.read_all_sweep_var_files()

print('Output files in json keys:')
pprint(sweep_reader.read_all_output_file_keys())
print()

print('Parameter sweep variables found:')
pprint(sweep_reader.read_all_sweep_var_files())
print()

#%%
# Now we use our sweep reader to read in the existing sweep results. We can also
# use a read configuration here if we want to filter out specific parts of the
# simulation output but for now we will read all of the data.
