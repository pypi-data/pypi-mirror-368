"""
Running a parameter sweep of a Gmsh and MOOSE simulation
================================================================================

In this example we will perform a parameter sweep of a gmsh-moose simulation
chain to demonstrate the capability of the 'herder' workflow manager. Here we
pass the 'herder' a list of simulation tools that we want to modify inputs for
(i.e. input modifiers) and then run (i.e. with runners). The simulation tools
are called sequentially in the order they are in the lists so we will need to
make sure we call gmsh first to generate the mesh and then call moose to use the
mesh to run the simulation.

As in the previous example we will generate a parameter sweep and then run it
sequentially and in parallel and compare the run times.

**Installing moose**: To run this example you will need to have installed moose
on your system. As moose supports unix operating systems windows users will need
to use windows subsystem for linux (WSL). We use the proteus moose build which
can be found here: https://github.com/aurora-multiphysics/proteus. Build scripts
for common linux distributions can be found in the 'scripts' directory of the
repo. You can also create your own moose build using instructions here:
https://mooseframework.inl.gov/.

**Installing gmsh**: For this example you will need to have a gmsh executable
which can be downloaded and installed from here: https://gmsh.info/#Download

We start by importing what we need for this example.

# We can now setup our grid parameter sweep to run simulations for all

# For the gmsh simulation parameters we pass a dictionary keyed by the variable
# we want to change and then an iterable object (e.g. tuple, list, numpy array)
# for all values of the variable we want to run. We can also have an iterable of
# strings which will insert expressions into the input file for us as shown for
# the plate height below. If we only want to analyse a single value of a
# parameter we just pass an iterable with a single element. Note that the list
# of parameters that we pass to the sweep grid function should be in the same
# order we intend to call our simulation tools - so gmsh first in this case.

# After running this example replace the moose params with the following:
# ``moose_params = {"EMod": (70e9,100e9),"PRatio": (0.3,0.35)}``. This should
