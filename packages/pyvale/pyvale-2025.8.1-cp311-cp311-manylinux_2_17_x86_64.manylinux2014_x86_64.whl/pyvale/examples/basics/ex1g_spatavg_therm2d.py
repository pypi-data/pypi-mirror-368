Basics: Sensor spatial averaging and averaging errors
================================================================================

In this example we show how `pyvale` can simulate sensor spatial averaging for
ground truth calculations as well as for calculating systematic errors.

Test case: Scalar field point sensors (thermocouples) on a 2D thermal simulation

# First we are going to build a custom sensor array so we can control how
# the ground truth is extracted for a sensor using area averaging. Note that
# the default is an ideal point sensor with no spatial averaging. Later we
# will add area averaging as a systematic error. Note that it is possible to
# have an ideal point sensor with no area averaging for the truth and then
# add an area averaging error. It is also possible to have a truth that is
# area averaged without and area averaging error. The first part of this is
# the same as the 3D thermal example we have used previously then we control
# the area averaging using the sensor data object.

# From here you now have everything you need to build your own sensor

# we will look at sensors applied to vector (e.g. displacement) and tensor
# fields (e.g. strain). If you don't need to sample vector or tensor fields
# then skip ahead to the examples on experiment simulation where you will
# learn how to perform Monte-Carlo sensor uncertainty quantification
# simulations and to analyse the results with pyvale.
