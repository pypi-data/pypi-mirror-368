"""
Basics: Tensor field sensors (strain gauges)
================================================================================

In this example we use the sensor array factory to build a set of strain
sensors that can sample the strain tensor field from a solid mechanics
simulation. In the next example we will examine how we can build custom tensor
field sensors as we did for scalar field in the first set of examples.

Note that this tutorial assumes you are familiar with the use of `pyvale` for
scalar fields as described in the first set of examples.

Test case: point strain sensors on a 2D plate with hole loaded in tension
