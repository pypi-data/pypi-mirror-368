Basics: Field-based systematic errors
================================================================================

In this example we give an overview of field-based systematic errors. Field
errors require additional interpolation of the underlying physical field such as
uncertainty in a sensors position or sampling time. For this example we will
focus on field error sources that perturb sensor locations and sampling times.
In later examples we will analyse sensor orientation for vector and tensor
fields.

Note that field errors are more computationally intensive than basic errors as
they require additional interpolations of the underlying physical field.

Test case: Scalar field point sensors (thermocouples) on a 3D thermal simulation

# First we use everything we learned from the first three examples to build
# a thermocouple sensor array for the same 3D thermal simulation we have

# systematic error called a field error which requires additional
# interpolation of the underlying physical field to be measured.

# positions on the face of the block using a normal distribution and we will
# also perturb the measurement times.
