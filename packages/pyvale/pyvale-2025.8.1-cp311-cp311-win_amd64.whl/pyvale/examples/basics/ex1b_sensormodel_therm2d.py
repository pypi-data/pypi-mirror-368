Basics: Sensor model & `get_measurements()` vs `calc_measurements()`
================================================================================

In this example we explain the `pyvale` virtual sensor measurement model. For a
virtual sensor in `pyvale` a measurement is defined as measurement = truth +
systematic error + random error. Sources of systematic errors include: spatial/
temporal averaging, uncertainty in position / sampling time / orientation,
digitisation, saturation, and calibration. Sources of random error are generally
due to measurement noise characterised by a given probability distribution.

Random errors can be mitigated by performing multiple experiments and averaging.
However, systematic errors cannot easily be accounted for without a forward
model of the source of the error. Characterising the contribution of systematic
errors to the total measurement error is a key application of `pyvale`.

A sensor array has two key methods: `get_measurements()` and `calc_measurements`
. Calling `get_measurements()` retrieves the results for the current simulated
experiment whereas calling `calc_measurements()` will generate a new simulated
experiment by sampling / calculating the systematic and random errors.
