Basics: Pyvale point sensor simulation
================================================================================

In this example we introduce the basic features of `pyvale` for point sensor
simulation. We demonstrate quick sensor array construction with defaults using
the `pyvale` sensor array factory. Finally we run a sensor simulation and display
the output.

Test case: Scalar field point sensors (thermocouples) on a 2D thermal simulation

# Here we load a pre-generated MOOSE finite element simulation dataset that
# comes packaged with pyvale. The simulation is a 2D rectangular plate with
# a bi-directional temperature gradient. You can replace this with the path
# to your own MOOSE simulation with exodus output (*.e). Note that the
# field_key must match the name of your variable in your MOOSE simulation.
# We use `mooseherder` to load the exodus file into a `SimData` object.
