Basics: Custom tensor field sensors (strain gauges) in 2D
================================================================================

In this example we build a custom tensor field sensor array (i.e. a strain gauge
array) in 2D.

Note that this tutorial assumes you are familiar with the use of `pyvale` for
scalar fields as described in the first set of examples.

Test case: point strain sensors on a 2D plate with hole loaded in tension

# First we load the same 2D solid mechanics simulation of a plate with a
# hole loaded in tension as a `SimData` object. We scale the units to mm
# from SI including the coordinates and displacement. Strain is unitless so
# we leave it alone.
