"""
Run Gmsh then MOOSE once
================================================================================

In this example we use a gmsh runner followed by a moose runner to generate our
mesh and then run a moose simulation using this mesh. The moose input file needs
to know the name of the gmsh .msh file which is specified in the gmsh .geo
script when the Save command is called. It is possible to use the input
modifiers we have seen previously to update this file name as a variable in the
moose input script but for this example we have set things manually inside the
moose input script.

**Installing moose**: To run this example you will need to have installed moose
on your system. As moose supports unix operating systems windows users will need
to use windows subsystem for linux (WSL). We use the proteus moose build which
can be found here: https://github.com/aurora-multiphysics/proteus. Build scripts
for common linux distributions can be found in the 'scripts' directory of the
repo. You can also create your own moose build using instructions here:
https://mooseframework.inl.gov/.

**Installing gmsh**: For this example you will need to have a gmsh executable
which can be downloaded and installed from here: https://gmsh.info/#Download

We start by importing what we need for this example.

# are - try opening them with your text editor of choice so you can see how the

# how the name is matched in the moose .i to read the .msh to run the sim.
