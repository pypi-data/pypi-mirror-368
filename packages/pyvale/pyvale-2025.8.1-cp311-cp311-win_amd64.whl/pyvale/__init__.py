"""
The python validation engine (`pyvale`) is your virtual engineering laboratory:
An all-in-one package for sensor simulation, sensor uncertainty quantification,
sensor placement optimisation and simulation calibration/validation. Used to
simulate experimental data from an input multi-physics simulation by explicitly
modelling sensors with realistic uncertainties. Useful for experimental design,
sensor placement optimisation, testing simulation validation metrics and
virtually testing digital shadows/twins.
