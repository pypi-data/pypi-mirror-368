Basics: Building a point sensor array from scratch with custom errors
================================================================================

Here we build a custom point sensor array from scratch that is similar to the
pre-built thermocouple array from example 1.1. For this example we switch to a
3D thermal simulation of a fusion heatsink component.

Test case: Scalar field point sensors (thermocouples) on a 3D thermal simulation

#%%
# To build our custom point sensor array we need to at minimum provide a
# `IField` (i.e. `FieldScaler`, `FieldVector`, `FieldTensor`) and a
# `SensorData` object. For labelling visualisations (e.g. axis labels and
# unit labels) we can also provide a `SensorDescriptor` object.
# Once we have built our `SensorArrayPoint` object from these we can then
# attach custom chains of different types of random and systematic errors
# to be evaluated when we run our measurement simulation. This example is
# based on the same thermal example we have used in the last two examples so
# we start by loading our simulation data:

data_path = dataset.thermal_3d_path()
sim_data = mh.ExodusReader(data_path).read_all_sim_data()

# field object to perform interpolation to the sensor locations at the
# desired sampling times.

# Next we need to create our `SensorData` object which will set the position
# and sampling times of our sensors. We use the same helper function we used
# previously to create a uniformly spaced grid of sensors in space

# to match the simulation time steps.

sensor_data = sens.SensorData(positions=sens_pos,
                             sample_times=sample_times)

# Finally, we can create a `SensorDescriptor` which will be used to label
# the visualisation and sensor trace plots we have seen in previous
# examples.

# If we want to simulate sources of uncertainty for our sensor array we need
# to add an `ErrIntegrator` to our sensor array using the method
# `set_error_integrator()`. We provide our `ErrIntegrator` a list of error
# objects which will be evaluated in the order specified in the list.
#
# In pyvale errors have a type specified as: random / systematic
# (`EErrorType`) and a dependence `EErrDependence` as: independent /
# dependent. When analysing errors all random all systematic errors are
# grouped and summed together.
#
# The error dependence determines if an error is
# calculated based on the truth (independent) or the accumulated measurement
# based on all previous errors in the chain (dependent). Some errors are
# purely independent such as random noise with a normal distribution with a
# set standard devitation. An example of an error that is dependent would be
# saturation which must be place last in the error chain and will clamp the
# final sensor value to be within the specified bounds.
#
# pyvale provides a library of different random `ErrRand*` and systematic
# `ErrSys*` errors which can be found listed in the docs. In the next
# example we will explore the error library but for now we will specify some
# common error types. Try experimenting with the code below to turn the
# different error types off and on to see how it changes the virtual sensor
# measurements.
#
# This systematic error is just a constant offset of -5 to all simulated
# measurements. Note that error values should be specified in the same
# units as the simulation.
#
# This systematic error samples from a uniform probability distribution.
