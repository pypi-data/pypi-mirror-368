"""
Rank calculation for divisors on chip-firing graphs.

This module provides functionality to calculate the rank of divisors on chip-firing graphs,
which is an important invariant in the theory of divisors on graphs. The rank measures
how much freedom you have to move chips around while keeping the divisor effective.

The implementation uses the Efficient Winnability Detection (EWD) algorithm as a building
block and provides both standard and optimized calculation modes.

    such that D-E is equivalent to an effective divisor for all effective divisors E of
    degree r. If D is not equivalent to an effective divisor, then r(D) = -1.

    The rank is computed as follows:

    1. If EWD(divisor) is not winnable, return -1.
    2. Starting with k = 1, consider all effective divisors E of degree k.
    3. For each such divisor E, check if D-E is winnable using the EWD algorithm. These checks
       are performed in parallel for a given k.
    4. If all checks for the current k are winnable, increment k and repeat step 2.
    5. Otherwise (if any check for D-E returns not winnable), the rank is k-1.
