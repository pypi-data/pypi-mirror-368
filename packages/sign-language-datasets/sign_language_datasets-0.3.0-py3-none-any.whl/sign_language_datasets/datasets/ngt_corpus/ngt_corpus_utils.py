Notes:

Annotation guidelines of third release: https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/islandora/object/tla%3A1839_00_0000_0000_0021_6AC3_1

Gloss annotations:
- Glosses are annotated separately for each hand
- the gloss tiers are called "GlossL" and "GlossR"
- two-handed signs are annotated identically on the tiers of both hands (this also inflates the overall count of
  annotated glosses

The translations into Dutch are in the tier called "TranslationNarrow".

Both gloss and translation tiers exist for both speakers S1 and S2. Hence, the actual tier names of interest are:
- GlossL S1
- GlossL S2
- GlossR S1
- GlossR S2
- TranslationNarrow S1
- TranslationNarrow S2

Not all ELAN files have gloss annotations or translations. The code needs to assume that any tier type could be missing.
