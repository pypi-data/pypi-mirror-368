TFNBS Toolbox is a Python package for computation and generation of network-based statistics for neuroscience data 
(i.e. fMRI, EEG data). The core concept is based on eliminating the use of a hardcoded threshold using threshold-free 
cluster enhancement (TFCE) scores to assess statistical significance. It works on the principle of networks, where TFCE 
statistical values are computed across a range of thresholds over n cycles of permutations to uncover possible significance in the data. 
Our implementation of TFNBS follows efficient computing and allows for computations to be performed on parallel cores therefore 
massively reducing computation time and resources.
