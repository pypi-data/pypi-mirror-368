              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Map Any Code Snippet into Vector Embedding with InferCode. 

This is a Tensorflow Implementation for "InferCode: Self-Supervised Learning of Code Representations by Predicting Subtrees" (ICSE'21). InferCode works based on the key idea of using an encoder to predict subtrees as a pretext task. Then the weights learned from the encoder can be used to transfer for other downstream tasks. This is to alleviate the need for the huge amount of labeled data to build decent code learning models in Software Engineering. With this concept, representation learning models for  source code can now learn from unlabeled data. 
    
We trained our model on a dataset comprised of 19 languages, which are: java, c, c++, c#, golang, javascript, lua, php, python, ruby, rust, scala, kotlin, solidity, haskell, r, html, css, bash. We use [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) as the backbone to parse these languages to AST. This is a bit different from the implementation we reported in our paper, which used [srcml](https://www.srcml.org/) as the AST parser. The reasons are that we found that tree-sitter supports more language than srcml, and tree-sitter also provides a [python binding interface](https://github.com/tree-sitter/py-tree-sitter), which makes it easy to parse any code snippet into AST by using python code. A details of our old implementation using srcml can be found in [old_version](old_version/).

## Set up
Install the Pypi package (current version is 0.0.32):
```python
pip3 install infercode
```
    
## Usage

Infercode can be tested/used as a command
```bash
infercode <file1>.<ext1> [<file2>.<ext2>...]
```
where `<file>` is a file name, and `<ext>` is the file extension. The file extension
will be used to select the programming language for infercode to choose the corresponding
parser. It will generate a numpy vector for each file in the argument.

You can also use `infercode` as a python library for more advanced uses:

```python
from infercode.client.infercode_client import InferCodeClient
import os
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Change from -1 to 0 to enable GPU
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = "-1"

infercode = InferCodeClient(language="c")
infercode.init_from_config()
vectors = infercode.encode(["for (i = 0; i < n; i++)", "struct book{ int num; char s[27]; }shu[1000];"])

print(vectors)

```
    
Then we have the output embeddings:
```bash

```

Note that on the initial step, the script will build tree-sitter parsers from sources into ```~/.tree-sitter/bin```, download our pretrained model, and store it into ```~/.infercode_data/model_checkpoint```.
    
## Compare to other work
- There are a few other techniques for code representation learning, but none of them are designed with the intention to have a pretrained model to convert code to vector. For example, [Code2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09473) (Alon et al.), despite the attractive name, Code2vec is not suitable to convert code to vector since they trained the model to predict the method name. If one wants to reuse the Code2vec model to convert code to vector, their implementation is not ready for this purpose. 
    
- There are also other pretrained models for code, such as CodeBert, GraphCodeBert, CuBert, etc, but they did not wrap their code into usable inferfaces.

- None of the above work supports such many languages like InferCode.
