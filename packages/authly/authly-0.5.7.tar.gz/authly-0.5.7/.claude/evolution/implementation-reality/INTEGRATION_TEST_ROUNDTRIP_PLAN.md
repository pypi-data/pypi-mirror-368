# Integration Test Roundtrip Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing end-to-end integration tests that demonstrate the complete OAuth 2.1 + OIDC infrastructure functionality. The goal is to create a roundtrip test that performs real admin operations and OAuth flows to verify the system works beyond just endpoint availability.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
