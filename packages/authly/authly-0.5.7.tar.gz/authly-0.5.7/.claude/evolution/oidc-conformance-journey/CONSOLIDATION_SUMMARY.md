# TCK Consolidation Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Consolidated Structure
**Before**: Multiple overlapping docs, complex setup, unclear workflow
**After**: Clean, simple structure with clear purpose for each file

```
tck/
├── README.md           # Main documentation (no redundancy)
├── QUICK_START.md      # 3-step guide to 90% compliance
├── Makefile            # Simple, focused commands
├── run-conformance.sh  # One-click conformance test
├── scripts/            # Core test scripts
├── reports/            # Test outputs (gitignored)
└── docs/               # Additional documentation
    └── BOUNDARIES.md   # Clear test type boundaries
```

### 2. ✅ Simplified Workflow

**Old workflow**: Complex multi-step process with Docker builds
**New workflow**: Three simple commands

```bash
docker compose up -d     # Start Authly
cd tck && make validate  # Run tests (90% compliance)
cat reports/latest/*     # View results
```

### 3. ✅ Updated CI/CD

**Old**: Complex 169-line workflow with Maven builds
**New**: Focused 134-line workflow targeting 90% compliance

- Runs on every push/PR
- Clear pass/fail at 90% threshold
- Automatic PR comments with results
- No unnecessary complexity

### 4. ✅ Eliminated Redundancy

Archived these redundant files:
- CONFORMANCE_WORKFLOW.md (replaced by README.md)
- WORKFLOW_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (replaced by QUICK_START.md)
- FIX_NOW.md (issues documented in README.md)
- EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES.md (not needed for 90% target)

### 5. ✅ Clear Reproducibility

Anyone can now achieve 90% compliance with:
```bash
./run-conformance.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
make validate
```

## Key Improvements

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Steps to 90%** | Unknown/complex | 3 simple commands |
| **Documentation** | Scattered, redundant | Single README + QUICK_START |
| **CI/CD** | 169 lines, complex | 134 lines, focused |
| **File count** | 12+ markdown files | 3 core docs |
| **Makefile** | 100+ lines | 65 clean lines |
| **Success criteria** | Unclear | 90% target clearly defined |

## Current Status

✅ **90% OIDC/OAuth Compliance Achieved**
- Discovery: 100% (22/22 checks)
- JWKS: 100% (7/7 checks)
- Endpoints: 50% (3/6 checks)
- Security: 80% (4/5 checks)
- **Overall: 36/40 checks pass**

## Next Steps

1. **Fix remaining 10%**:
   - Token endpoint error format
   - Authorization endpoint error handling

2. **Maintain simplicity**:
   - Don't add complexity
   - Keep 3-step workflow
   - Document in one place

3. **When ready for 100%**:
   - Fix the two known issues
   - Register for official certification
   - Use OpenID Foundation test suite
