## 6. Performance and Scalability

### ⚠️ **Good Foundation with Optimization Opportunities (3.5/5)**

**Current Performance Strengths:**
- **Async/Await**: Consistent non-blocking patterns throughout
- **Connection Pooling**: PostgreSQL connection pooling with psycopg-pool
- **Database Design**: Proper indexing and UUID primary keys
- **Token Management**: Efficient JTI tracking for revocation

**Performance Bottlenecks Identified:**
```python
# Areas for Optimization:

1. Database Access Patterns:
   - Uses autocommit mode which can hurt transaction performance
   - Missing bulk operations for token cleanup
   - N+1 query risks in scope/client relationships

2. Caching Strategy:
   - No Redis or in-memory caching layer
   - JWKS keys loaded from database on every request
   - Repeated configuration and user lookups

3. Concurrency Patterns:
   - Sequential token creation (access then refresh)
   - Blocking JWT operations could block event loop
   - Missing parallelization in authentication flows
```

**Scalability Considerations:**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Singleton pattern limits multi-instance deployment
- **State Management**: In-memory rate limiter not suitable for distributed setup
- **Load Balancing**: Missing health check endpoints for load balancer integration
- **Resource Management**: No circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies

**Recommended Optimizations:**
1. **Implement Redis Caching**: For tokens, user data, and rate limiting
2. **Parallelize Operations**: Create token pairs concurrently
3. **Add Health Checks**: Proper endpoints for load balancer integration
4. **Optimize Database**: Bulk operations and query optimization
5. **Remove Singletons**: Enable true stateless horizontal scaling

**Expected Performance Gains:**
- 50-70% reduction in database load with caching
- 3-5x improvement in token creation with parallelization
- Linear horizontal scaling with stateless design
