# DoorDash MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides DoorDash food ordering functionality to Claude Desktop.

## Important: Authentication Required

This MCP server requires a valid DoorDash organization ID to function. You must set the `DOORDASH_ORG_ID` environment variable before using this server.

To obtain an organization ID, you need to register with the DoorDash API platform.

## Features

- **Location-aware**: Uses your saved address when no coordinates provided
- **Unified API**: One search endpoint handles restaurants, grocery items, and more

### üõí **Advanced Cart Management**
- **Multi-store carts**: Separate carts for each restaurant/store
- **DoubleDash support**: Combine orders from 90+ compatible stores
- **Automatic cart selection**: Most recently active cart used for checkout
- **Smart pricing**: Unit prices in cents, exact option IDs required

### üéÅ **Auto-Gift Orders**

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/doordash-automation/doordash-mcp.git
cd doordash-mcp

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the MCP server
pip install -e .
```

### Option 2: Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install doordash-mcp
```

## Configuration

### 1. Set up your DoorDash Organization ID

You must obtain a valid DoorDash organization ID for API access. This is required and the server will not function without it.

Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export DOORDASH_ORG_ID="your-org-id-here"
```

**Note**: Replace `your-org-id-here` with your actual DoorDash organization ID.

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop

Add the DoorDash MCP server to your Claude Desktop configuration.

**On macOS:**
Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**On Windows:**
Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following to the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "doordash": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "doordash_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DOORDASH_ORG_ID": "your-org-id-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or if you installed from source:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "doordash": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/doordash-mcp/doordash_mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "DOORDASH_ORG_ID": "your-org-id-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

After updating the configuration, restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: The `place_order` tool will place REAL orders and charge your payment method! Only use it when you actually want to order food.

### üîë Critical Success Factors

**For add_to_cart:**
- ‚úÖ **Use EXACT values** from menu/search results - don't guess item IDs or prices
- ‚úÖ **Unit prices in CENTS** (e.g., $5.89 = 589 cents, not 5.89)
- ‚úÖ **Get option IDs first** from get_menu_item_details for items with size/customization
- ‚úÖ **Follow the workflow**: search ‚Üí restaurant details ‚Üí menu item details ‚Üí add to cart

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Don't guess item IDs - always get them from search/menu results
- ‚ùå Don't use dollars for unit_price - use cents (589 not 5.89)  
- ‚ùå Don't skip getting option IDs for items with size choices
- ‚ùå Don't forget to release sessions when done

**Cart Behavior:**
- Each restaurant has its own separate cart in DoorDash
- The most recently updated cart is used for checkout
- To checkout a different cart, add any item from that store first
- Sessions expire after 60 minutes - always release when done

## Development
