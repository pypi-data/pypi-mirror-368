# Modern CHANGELOG Automation for Python Projects

#### *A Step-by-Step Guide Using Conventional Commits and GitHub Actions*

Keeping a well-structured, up-to-date `CHANGELOG.md` is essential for any Python project‚Äîbut maintaining it manually is tedious and error-prone. Modern teams use automated tools to ensure every feature, bugfix, and change is documented accurately, directly from commit history. This guide walks you through **the industry-standard workflow** for Python apps: combining Conventional Commits, commit linting, and GitHub Actions with Release Drafter to generate a clean, fully automated changelog.

## Why Automate Your CHANGELOG?

A changelog tells users, teammates, and future-you what changed and why. But without automation:

* Developers forget to update it.
    
* Entries are inconsistent or missing.
    
* Releases require tedious manual review.
    

**Automating your changelog** ensures:

* Every change is tracked and categorized.
    
* Release notes are always ready to go.
    
* Less busywork, more focus on code.
    

* * *

## What Are Conventional Commits?

**Conventional Commits** are a simple convention for writing commit messages. Each message begins with a type (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.), optionally followed by a scope and a short description. For example:

```
feat(cli): add --help option
fix: correct typo in documentation
chore: update dependencies
```

**Why use them?**

* Tools can parse, group, and release based on these tags.
    
* Clean, human-readable history.
    
* Enables automated versioning and changelogs.
    

* * *

## The Best Toolchain for Python Projects

While many changelog tools exist, the modern, low-friction, cross-language standard stack is:

| Step | Tool(s) | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **commitlint + husky** | Enforce commit message conventions |
| 2 | **commitizen** (optional) | Guide contributors to write good commits |
| 3 | **Release Drafter** | Auto-generate CHANGELOG and release notes |
| 4 | **GitHub Actions** | Enforce checks & automation in CI |

> **Note:** These tools work for _any_ language‚Äîyour Python code and environment remain untouched.

* * *

## Step 1: Enforce Commit Message Standards with Commitlint

**commitlint** is the industry-standard linter for Conventional Commits. It doesn‚Äôt care what language your code is‚Äîjust that your commits follow the format.

### Installation

In your repo (you can use a `/devtools` folder to keep Node tools out of your main codebase):

```sh
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional husky
```

Add a commitlint config (`commitlint.config.js`):

```js
module.exports = {extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']};
```

### Add a Husky Git Hook

```sh
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg "npx --no-install commitlint --edit \$1"
```

Now, **every commit message is linted** before it's saved.

* * *

## Step 2: Make Commit Messages Easy with Commitizen (Optional)

**commitizen** provides an interactive CLI (`git cz`) to help you write well-formed commit messages. This removes guesswork and lowers the barrier for contributors.

```sh
npm install --save-dev commitizen
npx commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact
```

Add to your docs:

> ‚ÄúUse `npx git-cz` instead of `git commit` for a guided commit message prompt.‚Äù

* * *

## Step 3: Automate Your CHANGELOG with Release Drafter

**Release Drafter** is a GitHub Action that drafts release notes and updates your changelog based on merged pull requests‚Äîorganized by labels or by commit message tags.

### Set Up Release Drafter

1. Create `.github/release-drafter.yml` with category configuration:
    

    ```yaml
    name-template: 'v$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION'
    tag-template: 'v$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION'
    
    categories:
      - title: "üöÄ Features"
        pull_request_title:
          - '^feat(?:\\([^)]*\\))?:'
      - title: "üêõ Fixes"
        pull_request_title:
          - '^fix(?:\\([^)]*\\))?:'
      - title: "üßπ Chores"
        pull_request_title:
          - '^chore(?:\\([^)]*\\))?:'
    
    change-template: '- $TITLE @$AUTHOR (#$NUMBER)'
    ```

2. Add the Release Drafter Action to your workflows (e.g., `.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml`):
    

    ```yaml
    name: Release Drafter
    
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
      pull_request:
        types: [closed]
    
    jobs:
      update_release_draft:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: release-drafter/release-drafter@v6
            with:
              config-name: release-drafter.yml
            env:
              GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ```

Every time a PR is merged, a draft release and changelog is updated automatically.

* * *

## Step 4: CI Integration with GitHub Actions

**Don‚Äôt just enforce locally‚Äîuse CI too.**

Example `.github/workflows/commitlint.yml` for checking all commit messages on PRs:

```yaml
name: Commit Lint

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  commitlint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v6
```

This ensures no bad commits sneak in via PRs, even from forks or external contributors.

* * *

## Best Practices & Pro Tips

* **Document the workflow:** Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that explains the commit format, how to use `git cz`, and any local setup steps.
    
* **Keep Node tooling out of Python:** Isolate Node tools (commitlint, commitizen, husky) in `/devtools` or similar folder.
    
* **Use PR titles or commit messages:** Release Drafter can categorize changelog entries using either; just be consistent in your workflow.
    
* **Don‚Äôt forget labels:** Label PRs with `feature`, `fix`, etc., to give Release Drafter extra context.
    
* **Semantic-release?** If you want _full_ automation (including version bumps and PyPI deploys), semantic-release is another option, but it‚Äôs more common in JavaScript ecosystems.
    

* * *

## Sample devtools Folder and Config Files

```
devtools/
  package.json             # for commitlint, commitizen, husky, etc.
  commitlint.config.js
  .cz-config.js            # if you customize commitizen
  .husky/
.github/
  release-drafter.yml
  workflows/
    release-drafter.yml
    commitlint.yml
CONTRIBUTING.md
CHANGELOG.md               # (optional‚ÄîRelease Drafter keeps this up to date)
```

* * *

## Conclusion

**Automated changelogs are now standard, not a luxury.**  
By enforcing Conventional Commits, helping contributors with commitizen, and auto-generating your changelog and releases with Release Drafter and GitHub Actions, you‚Äôll save time, prevent errors, and deliver a polished developer experience‚Äîno matter how fast your project grows.

### üîß Addendum: Commit Message Linting in a Python Project

While developing this Python-based application, we identified the need to enforce **Conventional Commit** standards across the team to enable structured commit history, semantic versioning, and automated changelog generation.

However, at the time of implementation, **no mature Python-native tooling existed** to lint commit messages against the Conventional Commit specification in a way that:

* integrates cleanly with Git hooks (e.g., `commit-msg`)
* supports CI workflows
* provides extensibility and official presets

#### üõ† Solution

To address this, we introduced a **minimal Node.js-based dev dependency**, using the industry-standard tool:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional husky@^9.1.7
```

We created a `commitlint.config.cjs` file to extend the conventional ruleset:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
};
```

To enforce this across commits, we initialized Husky and configured it manually (as `husky add` is deprecated in v9+):

```bash
npx husky install
```

Then added the following to `package.json` to ensure Husky is activated after install:

```json
"scripts": {
  "prepare": "husky install"
}
```

Next, we manually created the `.husky/commit-msg` hook file using the updated, **v10-compatible** format:

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
@'
#!/bin/sh
npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"
'@ | Out-File -Encoding utf8 -NoNewline .husky/commit-msg
```

**On macOS / Linux:**

```bash
echo '#!/bin/sh
npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"' > .husky/commit-msg
chmod +x .husky/commit-msg
```

And verified the hook script was installed with the expected content:

**On macOS / Linux:**

```bash
cat .husky/commit-msg
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Get-Content .husky/commit-msg
```

Expected output:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The deprecated Husky bootstrapping line (`. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"`) was intentionally omitted for compatibility with Husky v10+.

This ensures all commit messages are validated prior to entry, even in collaborative or CI-driven environments.

#### üìå Rationale

Although this project is Python-first, the use of lightweight JavaScript tooling was justified due to the lack of equivalent enforcement tools in the Python ecosystem. This setup is isolated to development workflows and does not impact runtime, packaging, or deployment.
