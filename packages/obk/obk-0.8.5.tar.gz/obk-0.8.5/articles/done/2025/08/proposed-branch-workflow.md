## **Your Proposed Branching Workflow**

### **Branches:**

* **`main`**: Always stable, release-ready.
    
* **`next`**: Where all active feature/dev work happens.
    
* **`hotfix/x.y.z`**: Temporary branch from `main` for urgent fixes.
    

* * *

### **Hotfix Flow:**

1. **Branch from `main`**:
    
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b hotfix/1.2.3
    ```
    
2. **Fix, commit, test.**
    
3. **Merge hotfix back to `main`:**
    
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge hotfix/1.2.3
    ```
    
4. **Optionally tag a release on main** (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
    
5. **Rebase `next` onto `main`** (to bring in the hotfix):
    
    ```bash
    git checkout next
    git rebase main
    ```
    
6. **Rebase any child branches of `next`** as needed.

### **Why this is a strong approach:**

* **Main always reflects the latest production state.**
    
* **Next is never blocked by hotfixes,** but always catches up after.
    
* **Feature branches** (if you use them) hang off `next`, not `main`.
    
* **No confusion about where development happens** or what’s ready for release.

### **Potential Visual:**

```
main ---●-------●-----------●------------------> (stable, tags/releases)
  |       \                 /
  |        \               /
  |       next ---●---●---●---●---> (all new development)
  |       
hotfix/1.2.3 --●--------> (fix, then merge to main, then rebase next)
```

* * *

### **Best Practice Tips:**

* **Always fast-forward `next` to `main` after a hotfix** to avoid conflicts and history complexity.
    
* **Keep feature branches up to date with `next`**, especially after big merges/hotfixes.
    

* * *

**Bottom line:**

> Your workflow (main for releases, next for dev, hotfix from main, then rebase next) is **solid, simple, and widely adopted**.  
> It will scale well, keep your history clean, and make releases/hotfixes low-stress.
