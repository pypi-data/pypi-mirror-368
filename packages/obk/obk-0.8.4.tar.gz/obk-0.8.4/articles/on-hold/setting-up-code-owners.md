# Setting Up CODEOWNERS for Future-Proof GitHub Permissions

> This article provides a guide to configuring a `.github/CODEOWNERS` file for your repository. Although currently you are the sole contributor, setting up CODEOWNERS now can prepare your project for future collaboration and protection.

---

## 1. What is CODEOWNERS?

The `CODEOWNERS` file defines users or teams responsible for specific files or directories in a repository. When changes are proposed in a pull request affecting these paths, GitHub automatically requests review from the corresponding code owners.

---

## 2. Why Use CODEOWNERS?

Even in single-maintainer projects, `CODEOWNERS` adds an additional layer of PR protection:

* Ensures self-approvals follow explicit rules.
* Integrates with branch protection rules (e.g., require review from code owners).
* Prepares the repo for collaborators and future contributors.

---

## 3. Sample CODEOWNERS File

Create this file:

```bash
.github/CODEOWNERS
```

And add this content:

```text
* @your-github-username
```

Replace `@your-github-username` with your actual GitHub username.

---

## 4. Integration with Branch Protection

To enforce CODEOWNERS with PR requirements:

1. Go to **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules**
2. Edit your rule for `main` or `deploy`
3. Enable:

   * [x] Require a pull request before merging
   * [x] Require review from Code Owners
4. Optional: Set **Required Approvals** to 1 or more

This ensures even if you're the only code owner, GitHub will not allow merging a PR unless you've explicitly reviewed it.

---

## 5. Optional Enhancements

You may add these for stricter enforcement:

* Require approval of most recent reviewable push
* Require conversation resolution before merging
* Automatically request Copilot code review (optional)

These options enhance auditability and prevent accidental merges.

---

## 6. When Should You Add CODEOWNERS?

Use CODEOWNERS if:

* You're preparing for collaboration
* You want consistent audit protection for PR merges
* You want to ensure reviews, even in single-maintainer workflows

Skip or disable it if:

* You are the sole contributor and prefer fast iteration for now

---

Let me know if you'd like a dynamic CODEOWNERS template that adjusts based on project directory structure or contributor roles.
