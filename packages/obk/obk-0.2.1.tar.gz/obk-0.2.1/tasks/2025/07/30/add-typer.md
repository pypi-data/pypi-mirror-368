## Add Typer

**Objective:**  
Sequentially implement and test features in `obk` by reproducing behaviors from `articles\doing\when-to-use-typer.md`. All changes should be delivered as a single, unified change set.

---

### 1. Repository Analysis

- Analyze the `obk` repository to understand its structure and capabilities.

---

### 2. Reference Article & Feature Extraction

- Review `articles\doing\when-to-use-typer.md` and extract required CLI features or patterns (list explicitly if possible).

---

### 3. Manual Testing & Iteration

- Review `articles\doing\one-line-manual-tests.md` for manual test best practices.
- In prompt `20250730T160316-0400`, write single-line manual tests in `<gsl-tdd>`, each in its own `<gsl-test>` element, covering all required behaviors and edge cases.
- Iterate on implementation until all tests pass.

### 4. Modification Policy

**Allowed file changes:**  
- Python source: `*.py`
- Config: `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `requirements.txt`, `MANIFEST.in`
