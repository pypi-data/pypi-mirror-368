## [Maintenance Task] Generate and Maintain a Minimal, Current README.md

**Objective:**  
Ensure the `README.md` at the repository root exists and accurately summarizes the current state of the `obk` codebase, providing essential installation, usage, and contribution instructions. The README should be concise, easy to follow, and should not exceed 80 lines.

* * *

### Steps

1. **Review the Prompts Folder and Current Codebase**
    
    * Review the files in `prompts` to set context of progress.
    
    * Scan the codebase for current functionality, CLI commands, major modules, and setup steps.
        
    * Note any features, requirements, or usage examples needed for basic understanding.


        
2. **Create or Update README.md**
    
    * If no `README.md` exists, create one using the template provided below as a base, updating all placeholder values with actual project data.
        
    * If `README.md` exists, update it to accurately reflect the latest state of the project, following the template structure and style.
        
    * Ensure the README does not exceed 80 lines and contains only essential information. Avoid unnecessary detail or “changelog”/roadmap content.
        
3. **Standard Template**
    
    * The README must include (in this order):
        
        1. Project Title and brief description
            
        2. Installation/Requirements (commands for `pip`, etc.)
            
        3. Quickstart / Usage (CLI or API examples)
            
        4. Features or commands list (concise)
            
        5. Contribution guidelines (if relevant)
            
        6. License (if any)
            
    * You may omit Contribution or License if not applicable, but must stay within the line limit.

### README.md Template

```markdown
# obk

> ⚠️ This project is in early development (pre-release/alpha).  
> The current release is a “hello world” scaffold. APIs and behavior will change rapidly as features are added over the coming weeks.

OBK is a programmable system for documenting, validating, and querying project knowledge in a way that travels with the repo. It lets teams define prompts—describing inputs, outputs, workflows, and tests—in a structured, machine-readable way. Prompts are validated with XSD schemas, tracked in SQLite, and made available for both ad-hoc reporting and agent-driven queries. The ultimate goal is to connect OBK to agents that can answer detailed questions about a developing application using this structured data.

## Installation

```bash
pip install obk
```

## Quickstart

```bash
obk [command] [options]
# Example:
obk hello-world
```

## Features

* [Feature 1: e.g., "Generate structured prompts"]
    
* [Feature 2: e.g., "Stacked branch workflows"]
    
* [Add/remove features to match current codebase, keep to 5 or fewer lines]
    

## Usage

For help on any command:

```bash
obk --help
```

## License

[SPDX or plain-text, e.g., MIT]
