## [Maintenance Task] Sync CHANGELOG with GitHub Releases

**Objective:**  
Verify that the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the `obk` repository root is fully up to date with all release entries as shown on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bynbb/obk/releases). If any differences are found, update `CHANGELOG.md` to accurately reflect the latest release notes, version numbers, and dates.

### Steps

1. **Review GitHub Releases**
    
    * Visit [https://github.com/bynbb/obk/releases](https://github.com/bynbb/obk/releases).
        
    * Note each release version, release date, title, and body text.
        
2. **Compare with CHANGELOG.md**
    
    * Open the `CHANGELOG.md` file at the root of the repository.
        
    * Carefully compare all versions, dates, and release notes against those shown on the GitHub Releases page.
        
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md (if needed)**
    
    * If any release is missing, out of order, or differs in content, update `CHANGELOG.md` so it fully matches GitHub Releases.
        
    * Preserve the formatting style of the existing changelog.
        
    * Include all release notes, version numbers, release dates, and any relevant summary text from each GitHub release.
        
    * If no changes are needed, make no edits.
