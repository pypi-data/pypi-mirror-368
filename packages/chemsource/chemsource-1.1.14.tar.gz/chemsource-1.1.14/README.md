chemsource is a Python tool for exposomics research that classifies chemical compounds based on their exposure sources. It retrieves information from Wikipedia and PubMed, then uses large language models to classify chemicals into user-defined categories.


## Quick Start

```python
from chemsource import ChemSource

# Initialize with your OpenAI API key
chem = ChemSource(model_api_key="your_openai_api_key")

# Classify a compound
info, classification = chem.chemsource("aspirin")
print(f"Classification: {classification}")
```

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install chemsource
```

**Note**: chemsource uses OpenAI's API services which incur costs based on usage. New users receive $5 in free credits, sufficient for testing purposes. Other lower-cost endpoints are also available for classification (e.g. DeepSeek, gpt-oss, etc.). In particular, as of the creation of this package, Google Gemini provides a reasonable amount of free API credits.
