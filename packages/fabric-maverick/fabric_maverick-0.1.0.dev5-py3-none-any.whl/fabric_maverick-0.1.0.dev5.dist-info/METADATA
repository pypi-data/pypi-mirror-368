## Overview

`fabric_maverick` is a Python package designed for **semantic level validation and comparison of Power BI reports across different workspaces**. It provides a robust framework to programmatically compare the metadata and structure of your Fabric Analytics Reports (formerly Power BI datasets/reports) to ensure consistency and identify discrepancies.

This package is particularly useful for:
* **CI/CD pipelines:** Automating report validation as part of your deployment process.
* **Regression testing:** Ensuring that changes to reports or underlying data models do not introduce unintended breaking changes.
* **Maintaining consistency:** Verifying that reports deployed to different environments (Dev, QA, Prod) are structurally identical or conform to expected variations.

## Features

* **Report Comparison:** Easily compare the structure (tables, columns, measures) of two Fabric Analytics Reports from different workspaces.
* **Flexible Input:** Supports comparing reports by providing individual report/workspace names or a consolidated dictionary structure.
* **Authentication Management:** Integrates with a flexible token provider for seamless authentication with Fabric/Power BI services.
* **Detailed Insights:** [TODO: Briefly describe what kind of comparison results/details the `ReportComparison` object provides. E.g., "Identifies added, removed, or modified tables, columns, and measures."]
* **Extensible:** Built with a modular design to allow for future expansion of comparison metrics and validation rules.

## Installation

`fabric_maverick` can be installed directly from PyPI using `pip`:
```bash
pip install fabric_maverick
```

## Usage
# Comparing Reports
The primary function for comparing reports is ReportCompare. It offers two ways to specify the reports:

```python
import knnpy

Compare = knnpy.ReportCompare(
    OldReport="MySalesDashboard_V1",
    OldReportWorkspace="Development",
    NewReport="MySalesDashboard_V2",
    NewReportWorkspace="Production",
    Stream="SalesDashboard_Deployment",
    ExplicitToken="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_IF_NEEDED" # Optional
)

# Use the Compare object to run validations and view results
Compare.run_all_validations()
```
# Authentication

By default, fabric_maverick will use token from fabric enviornment. However, you can explicitly provide an authentication token using the ExplicitToken parameter in ReportCompare:

```python
import knnpy

# Obtain your Power BI/Fabric access token
my_token = "eyJ..." # Replace with your actual token

comparison_result = knnpy.ReportCompare(
    # ... report details ...
    Stream="MyStream",
    ExplicitToken=my_token
)
```
Alternatively, you can initialize a token globally for the session using initializeToken:

```python
import knnpy

# Initialize token globally (this affects all subsequent calls without ExplicitToken)
knnpy.initializeToken("YOUR_GLOBAL_ACCESS_TOKEN")

# Now, ReportCompare calls can omit ExplicitToken
comparison_result = knnpy.ReportCompare(
    OldReport="ReportA",
    OldReportWorkspace="WS_A",
    NewReport="ReportB",
    NewReportWorkspace="WS_B",
    Stream="AnotherStream"
)
```
