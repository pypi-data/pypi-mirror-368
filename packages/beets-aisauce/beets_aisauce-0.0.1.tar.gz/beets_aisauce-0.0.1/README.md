# Beets AI Sauce Plugin
*Because your tunes deserve a little extra flavor.*

Let artificial intelligence decipher and enhance the mysterious metadata of your music tracks.


## Who Needs This? (Definitely You)

- **You**: The person who once gazed at your MP3 folder and thought, "My beats need more AI jazz hands!"
- **Also You**: If you trust AI more than your friend who can't stop labeling everything "Track 1".
- **Definitely You**: If you own folders full of tracks from bootlegs, unknown rips, or suspect compilation albums.


## Features

- **Auto-Metadata Magic**: Automatically retrieve and correct track and album metadata using AI-generated suggestions.
- **Cleanup Crew**: Strip away unnecessary embellishments like "Free Download" in titles or SHOUTCAPS, giving your library a polished appearance.
- **Extensible System**: Leverage AI configurations and prompts custom tailored for your library needs.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Beets**: Make sure you have Beets installed (`pip install beets`),
- **AI Service API Key**: Get an API key from your preferred AI service provider (e.g., OpenAI, Deepseek).
    - Any service that supports openAI endpoints should work.

### Plugin Setup

1. **Installation**: Obtain the sauce by installing the plugin via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install beets-aisauce
   ```
2. **Configuration**: Add the plugin to your Beets configuration file (`config.yaml`):
   ```yaml
    plugins: 
      - aisauce

    aisauce:
        providers:
            - id: openai
              model: gpt-4o
              api_key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
              api_base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
    ```
3. Execute the Ai Sauce: Import your tracks through Beets to start receiving AI-enhanced metadata suggestions.


## Advanced Usage

- **Custom Rules**: Sometimes you have specific metadata correction rules that you want to apply. You can modify the default user and system prompts by adding a `source` to your configuration file:
    ```yaml
    aisauce:
        providers:
            - id: openai
              model: gpt-4o
              api_key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

        sources:
            - provider_id: openai
              user_prompt: '
                Additional rules:
                - Replace any occurrences of Vulgar or inappropriate words with "**sauced**".
                '
    ```
- Multiple sources can be defined allowing you to test different prompts or configurations for different types of music or metadata corrections and models.

Great ideas welcome! Especially if they include more puns. Open a PR or send us a message in a bottle (GitHub issues also work).

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT Licenseâ€”meaning you can do almost anything, but please don't sue us if the AI names your tracks "Untitled Jam 42."



## Development

The following sections are for developers who want to contribute to the project. Feel free to skip if you're just here for the AI sauce.

### Installation for Development

Clone the repository and install the package in editable mode:

```bash
git clone
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Running Tests
To run the tests, you can use `pytest`. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pytest .
```

### Running mypy locally

Running mypy local is a bit tricky due to the namespace packages used in this project. To run mypy, you need to specify the `--namespace-packages` and `--explicit-package-bases` flags.

```bash
mypy  --namespace-packages --explicit-package-bases .
```
