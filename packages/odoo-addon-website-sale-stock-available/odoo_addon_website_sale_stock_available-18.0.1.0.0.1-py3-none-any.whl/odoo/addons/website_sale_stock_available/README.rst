This module extends the functionality of the *Product Availability*
module (technical name: ``website_sale_stock``) so that for the
eCommerce the *Available* quantity of a product is taken into account
instead of the *free* quantity.

Note that in the past the eCommerce availability was based in
*Forecasted quantity*. This isn't true anymore from version 15.0.

If a product is configured to *prevent sales if not enough stock* (see
configuration section) and its page is accessed in the Website Shop, the
availability messages will be based on the *Available* quantity instead
of *Free* quantity. And also, the eCommerce won't allow you to buy more
products than *Available* quantity (not *Free* quantity isn't taken into
account).

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to *Inventory > Products > Products* and edit a product that you
   only want to sell in the eCommerce if there is enough stock.
2. Navigate to *Out-of-stock (continue selling)* field in the *Sales*
   tab and unset it.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to your eCommerce.
2. Select a product that you has been previously configured to *prevent
   sales if not enough stock* for the web product page.
3. Odoo doesn't allow you to add the product to the cart if *Available*
   quantity (not *Free to use* quantity) is equal or less than zero.
   Besides, availability messages will be based on the *Available*
   quantity instead of the *Free to use* quantity.
