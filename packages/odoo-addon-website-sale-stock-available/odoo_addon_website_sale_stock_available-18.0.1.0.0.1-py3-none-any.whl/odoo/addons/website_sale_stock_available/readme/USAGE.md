To use this module, you need to:

1.  Go to your eCommerce.
2.  Select a product that you has been previously configured to *prevent
    sales if not enough stock* for the web product page.
3.  Odoo doesn't allow you to add the product to the cart if *Available*
    quantity (not *Free to use* quantity) is equal or less than zero.
    Besides, availability messages will be based on the *Available*
    quantity instead of the *Free to use* quantity.
